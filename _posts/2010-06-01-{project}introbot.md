Final exercise of the final year Intelligent Robotics module. We had to work in a team of four to design a system which would guide meeting attendees to one of several meeting rooms. We used depth data from a Kinect combined with a face size model to identify faces, and a probabilistic road map to navigate the task space. The system was implemented in ROS Java.

Winner of the "Best Robot" prize.

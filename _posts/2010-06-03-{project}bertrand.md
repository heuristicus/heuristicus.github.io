I worked on this project with [Horatio Caine](http://hxcaine.com/). The project
was for 50% credit on the Parallel Programming course in the final study
year. We investigated the effect of introducing loyalty into a posted offer
market, using a multi-agent simulation in CUDA to model the interactions between
consumers and manufacturers. We found that the introduction of loyalty meant
that a [Bertrand equilibrium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_competition) was not reached.

The project received a special mention for the "most scientifically accomplished
project" on the course.

The project was for 50% credit on the Parallel Programming course in the final
study year. We investigated the effect of introducing loyalty into a posted
offer market, using a multi-agent simulation in CUDA to model the interactions
between consumers and manufacturers. We found that the introduction of loyalty
meant that a Bertrand equilibrium) was
not reached.

I worked on this project with [Horatio Caine](http://hxcaine.com/). We received
a special mention for the "most scientifically accomplished project" on the
course.

# Detailed Description
### Bertrand Equilibria and Posted Offer Markets

Although these phrases sound complex, they are actually quite simple. Let's
start with the Bertrand equilibrium. The equilibrium comes about when Bertrand
competition is used to model the interaction between consumers and
manufacturers. Consumers purchase some quantity of products from the
manufacturer, based on the cost of the product set by the manufacturer. The
model relies on several assumptions:

- The quality of the products produced by each manufacturer is identical.
- The manufacturers cannot cooperate; there is no price fixing.
- Consumers will buy from the manufacturer with the cheapest product.
- If both manufacturers have the same price, demand is evenly split.

Dissertation project. I developed a system in C to automatically estimate the time delays between streams of gravitationally lensed photons. I created a photon stream simulator, using Poisson processes to model the arrival times of photons. I used a least squares method to build a baseline estimator which can be used to perform linear estimates of functions. Time delay estimation was done using this baseline estimator combined with either a numerical or probabilistic method to determine the goodness of fit between models.

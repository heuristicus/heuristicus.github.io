After finishing my summer project on Wednesday, I returned home to London. I was intending to get packing done in a relatively short time since it usually only takes about an hour or so at most even if I'm moving everything I own. After finishing packing, I wanted to spend a while messing around with emacs and setting up various things on my laptop and netbook, but I haven't even turned them on, getting dragged into cooking various cakes with my sister. Millionaire's shortbread and eve's pudding both came out pretty well, and I decided to make yakisoba with the left over noodles that I had. It was pretty good; possibly the most vegetables I have ever had in a single dish, but good nonetheless (we slipped some bacon in). I have no idea whether it was a reasonable representation of actual yakisoba, since I just got some stir fry vegetable mix and used that. I guess I'll find out pretty soon what proper yakisoba is like.

It didn't actually take that long to decide what to take, but after packing the clothes I was planning to take, there was worryingly little space remaining in my main luggage, so I decided to repack. The culprits were a hoody and a fleece, and since I keep hearing that Tokyo (and Japan in general) is still pretty hot at this time of year I've decided to abandon them and just take the minimum of winter-type clothing and buy anything that I need once it actually gets cold enough to warrant it.

Following the advice of many blogs and people that I have met who have been to Japan for extended periods of time, I have purchased a large amount of toothpaste and deodorant (I still can't get used to the missing u). Maybe I'll get some Japanese toothpaste and deodorant once I'm over there, just to see if it's actually true what the internet tells me.

I also bought some tea for gifting to people, since as far as I know, that's the done thing. I don't actually drink tea, but this stuff smells pretty damn good. The main reason I went for tea is that it, at least for me, is a part of British culture that most people know about, and isn't something that I perceive as negative in some/many ways (e.g. binge drinking, fish &amp; chips, etc.). I don't know how I'd go about bringing binge drinking to Japan, but from what I've seen and read, they seem to be experts at it already. Suffice to say, I thought that tea would be a gift that people might actually appreciate, and I wanted something that represents Britain to some extent. If that implies gentlemen with suspenders (no, not that kind) and smart shirts sipping steaming tea from a flower-emblazoned china teacup while sitting in a leather armchair with a high back in a study filled with really nice hardback books, then all the better. Probably not the image that will be conjured up ... maybe this is just what I imagine proper British people as.

One of the more interesting parts of the past few days has been getting a rather large amount of money changed. Walking around with that much cash brings out the paranoia a little...

Japanese notes are rather nice, if only for the fact that they have their value written in kanji as well as arabic numerals (of course). I found that the 10,000 yen (currently Â£80!) note, as with many Japanese official documents such as passports, has a very interesting font for the kanji, all curved, and filling the whole 'box' that you have as a boundary for each character. It's pretty difficult to read the font since a lot of the strokes are much longer than those in normal fonts and written Japanese.

This will be my first time travelling out of Europe, and therefore also the first time that I have been on a plane for more than 2 hours. 11 hours and 45 minutes is quite a long time, but hopefully I can persuade myself to sleep for most of that so that I don't end up being dead at 9:30 in the morning.

I found some useful sites for planning where to sit on flights. [Seatguru](http://www.seatguru.com) lets you see the layout of the plane, and also some information about each seat. [gcmap](http://www.gcmap.com) is a great circle mapper, so you can see the route that the plane is likely to take. It's pretty cool. I wanted to sit on the right side, since there's probably more interesting stuff on that side. At least, there's more of Russia on that side, and more of the sea between Japan and China, but I doubt it makes a difference which side I sit on, really, since Russia is bloody massive. Turns out that Virgin's website is terrible, and whilst I was in the middle of moving my seat on their selection thing, the site decided to error, and now I'm stuck with a seat in the middle. I'll probably try and get a window seat, since it'd be a shame not to get any shots of going over Scandinavia, Russia and Japan. We'll see how it goes.

Things I learned about packing:
- Clothes make for good cushions for things that you don't want to get crushed (obvious)
- Toothpaste tubes don't stack very nicely (something you don't really consider)

Excitement isn't a word that I'd use to describe any sort of feeling that I have now. If anything, it's a feeling of apprehension that Japan will, to some extent, be exactly what I expect, and also in some ways be completely different to my expectations. I feel that I know a lot about the country after watching quite a lot of TV shows and so on, but that only provides information on the top layer of living in Japan. There are probably plenty of things that I'm making incorrect assumptions about, and things that I will not have come across at all. In the end though, that's not really worrying me too much. I know that this is going to be interesting, and that comes before all else.

See you on the other side ...

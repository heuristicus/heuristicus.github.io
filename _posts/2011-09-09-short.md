Been waking up at 4am, jet lag seems to be persisting despite my efforts to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Stuff is going pretty well. I've got a phone and a bank account, and a 定期券 (teikiken), which lets me travel on a specific route on the metro for quite a lot cheaper than just paying the normal fare. I go from 日吉 (Hiyoshi) to 田町 (Tamachi) via 渋谷 (Shibuya). We've had some orientation stuff, filling in a load of forms. Forms for absolutely everything here. Two for the bank, two for the phone, two for accommodation check-in, and another 6 or so for various things to do with Keio. Met a few people as well, although mostly exchange students, which isn't particularly what I'm interested in. I also had my first crowded train experience on the way to Shibuya. Not really had time to go anywhere to take photos, but hopefully I'll get the chance to go during the weekend and take a few.

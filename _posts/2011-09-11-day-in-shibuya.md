I spent Saturday walking around Shibuya, trying to get some decent pictures. Nothing really came out particularly well, but I came across a parade of students. A pretty interesting parade, they were trying to "make Japan happy". I followed them all the way to Yoyogi park, where I talked to them for a while. Turns out there were quite a few people from Keio, so I got some of their numbers. Might meet up with them for lunch sometime.

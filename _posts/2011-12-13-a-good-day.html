Today, I have had a Good Day. Yes, with capital letters.

Started off with the usual lessons, where we did nothing particularly interesting, but it was enjoyable as usual. After that, I had a 5 hour break before I had my second shift at work. I spent a while contemplating what to do, and eventually decided to go to Shibuya, which is where I always go when I want to go somewhere and can't really think of anywhere. Hung around the Book Off, hunting for books in the 105 section, but didn't find anything new. Had a look around the used clothes shop on the bottom floor (which is quite good, although not actually that much cheaper than buying retail. Uniqlo and that other shop...H&amp;M are probably cheaper.) decided I didn't have enough money to spend on anything new, and couldn't really be bothered to look through tons of stuff to find something nice.

I decided to head home and have a nap, but ended up attempting to cook some meat with some peppers and various Japanese condiments, but it came out very average. I also discovered that the bottom shelf of my fridge is a freezer, and not split into a freezer and fridge. This resulted in the peppers being interesting to cut, and some rather brown bananas. I headed back to work (total time spent commuting today: 4 hours). Even though it was only my second real day on the job, I think I'm getting used to things pretty quickly. My use of words may not be sufficiently polite at times, and I'm sure I'm still making mistakes, but I took quite a few orders, and served plenty more people than before. I also learned (not really an appropriate word, but it'll have to do) how to change the grille on the brazier used to cook the mean, and how to clean up tables after customers have left. I got asked a few questions by some salarymen, and ended up talking to two guys for 5 minutes or so after I'd delivered them their tea. If things keep going this way, I might actually have a chance to use more Japanese than I thought I would, but the scope of conversation is rather limited. Nonetheless, I was pleased that someone went out of their way to talk to me. I also learned that I can't guess people's age, unless it's really obvious. I thought my 17 year old co-worker was a university student, which she seemed pleased about. Thinking about it now, aren't people of the female persuasion supposed to be annoyed when you guess their age above what it actually is? Perhaps it's different for high school students.

My shift finished, and I was rather tired after standing for 4 hours straight. Given my usual sedentary lifestyle sitting in front of a computer screen in a not-particularly-comfortable chair for 12+ hours a day, this is not really surprising. I got home, and decided to check my emails, and there was one from Keio. For a moment I disregarded it as some more information about something I wasn't particularly interested in, but I read it anyway. I was rather surprised to find that I had been selected as a recipient of the additional allocation JASSO scholarship, whatever that may mean. Whatever it means, the key point is that I have been allocated this scholarship for three months. The JASSO scholarship was something that we could apply for during the application period for the study abroad year, and of course I went for it, because why the hell not. It's a scholarship from the Japanese government (who seem to really like handing out money to foreign people, even though they seem to dislike them rather a lot [see: JET]), which gives a monthly stipend of ￥80,000. Some students get this for the whole study abroad period, but I don't think that anyone from Birmingham has received it. I'm rather pleased to get this, since the current state of the pound/yen is massively in the favour of the yen at the moment (i.e. the pound is terrible), and it will mean that at least I can feel a little bit more free about spending some money. Also, a scholarship is a nice thing to put on my CV, even though I can't even remember why it's awarded (I seem to remember it being randomly chosen, but that is surely incorrect).

Maybe today wasn't a good day after all. I'm inexperienced in experiencing good days, so I can't tell.

Oh well.

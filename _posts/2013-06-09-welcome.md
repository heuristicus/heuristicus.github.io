Welcome to my new website. I kept telling myself that I needed to make myself a
one, but never managed to get round to it. Until now. Having finished exams I
decided that either I'd do it now, or it would have to wait another two years at
least.

With that, let's go into some more detail on exactly what I've done. The site is
generated using a very nice static site generator,
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which was recommended to me quite a while ago by
[Jeremiah Via](http://jeremiahvia.com). Jekyll transforms plain text files
(mostly HTML and [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)) into
a mess of HTML which hopefully looks just as you wanted it to. Working with HTML
and CSS hasn't been particularly fun. Having not used either since secondary
school, it's taken me a while to work out how to control the things that I want
to control. Some things are still confusing, but hopefully once I get things
right once the next time I need to do something similar I'll know basically what
to do. I set up the basic parts required for Jekyll by following
[this tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/building-static-sites-with-jekyll/)
and some of the information on the official page, and after that it was mostly
tweaking the CSS.

Since you're reading this, you can see another thing that Jekyll does---it
creates pages for blog posts from either markdown or HTML files. Being one of
those people who uses [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) for
everything, this is a Good Thing. I can write posts directly into Emacs without
having to access some web interface, which means that I can use all the packages
I've collected in the past three years. Jekyll uses the
[Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/) library, which frees you from having to write
HTML for every post on the site. Just work out the structure you want to have
each post follow, throw it into a for loop over all the posts on your
site, and you're done. Here's the code which generates the [blog](/blog).

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}

    <section class="content">
      <div id="posts">
    
        {% for post in site.posts offset: 0 limit: 5 %}
        <div class="fullpost">
          <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
          {{ post.date | date: "%b %d, %Y" }}
    
          <section class="postcontent">
    	    {{ post.content }}
          </section>
          
          <section class="posttags">
    	    Filed under {{ post.tags | array_to_sentence_string }}.
          </section>
        </div>
        <div class="breaker"></div>
        {% endfor %}
      </div>
   </section>

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Ignoring my terrible HTML, it's rather neat.

You may have noticed the pretty code highlighting in the snippet above. This is
done with the [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) syntax highlighter, which Jekyll
can be set up to run whenever the site is built. It converts code in special
Liquid tags into a mass of HTML elements, which are then coloured with CSS
generated from one of the themes which comes with Pygments. Being unimaginative
as usual, I'm using the
[Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) font (which
you may or may not be able to see, depending on your browser), which
I've been using in Emacs and IDEs since I discovered it a couple of years
ago. I've looked around for other programming fonts, but haven't yet found any
which are better---if you know a good one, let me know! You might find some
other good-looking fonts for coding
[here](http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts) and
[here](http://www.slant.co/topics/67/~what-are-the-best-programming-fonts).

I also couldn't help but add something which can display proper mathematical
equations. Leaving aside whether I'll actually use the feature, it's definitely
something which I could not be without. The site uses the
[MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) display engine to render equations. You can
right click to retrieve the `$\LaTeX$` code, zoom, and do various other useful
things. Try it out on the equations below. 


_Bayes' Theorem_
`\[P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}\]`

_Q-learning_
`\[Q_{t+1}(s_t,a_t)=Q_t(s_t,a_t)+\alpha(s_t,a_t)\cdot\left[R_{t_1}+\gamma\max_aQ_t(s_{t+1},a)-Q_t(s_t,a_t)\right]\]`

_Jacobian matrix_
`\begin{align}
	J=\begin{bmatrix}
	\frac{\partial{F_1}}{\partial{x_1}}&\dots &\frac{\partial{F_1}}{\partial{x_n}}\\
	\vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
	\frac{\partial{F_m}}{\partial{x_1}}&\dots &\frac{\partial{F_m}}{\partial{x_n}}\\
	\end{bmatrix}
 \end{align}`

It took a little while to get this stuff all rendering correctly. Javascript is
required, and by default doesn't work with markdown because when the files are
parsed markdown converts some characters to HTML, which means that MathJax no
longer picks up the equations correctly. I managed to get things working thanks
to these
[two](http://checkmyworking.com/2012/01/how-to-get-beautifully-typeset-maths-on-your-blog/)
[posts](http://doswa.com/2011/07/20/mathjax-in-markdown.html). Having sorted
that, I was getting orange text instead of the black I expected. Turns out
MathJax uses the same CSS styles as some of those in the Pygments CSS file used
to do code highlighting. Thankfully, the first google
[result](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/mathjax-users/FgCBLdT15nM)
solved the problem by just adding some more CSS to override the definitions.

The design for the site, simple as it is, was inspired by
[Rasmus Andersson](http://rsms.me/)'s homepage, which is one of the pages
featured on the Jekyll site. The
[Github repository](https://github.com/rsms/rsms.github.com) for his page has
all of the CSS and HTML he uses, so after poring over that for a couple of days
I finally managed to work out how things pieced together and implement something
vaguely similar. I'm using the fantastic
[Linux Libertine](http://www.linuxlibertine.org/) fonts as the standard font,
which I use for almost everything now (including
[my dissertation](/projects/gravlens/)). The site should look reasonably good no
matter what device it's viewed on, because I'm arranging everything based on
proportions of the height and width. The font also changes size depending on the
width of the window you're viewing the site in (the site updates automatically
if you're in Firefox or IE, but you'll need to refresh to see the effect in
Chrome), which should make things much less ugly even when you're looking at it
in a tiny window (stop it). If something on the site doesn't work or looks
weird, then I'd appreciate if you could let me know so I can try and fix it.

Some things which could be considered quite important have happened over the
past year, but I'll leave that to another post which may or may not
materialise. The result of those things is that I'm heading off to Sweden
tomorrow to do a master's in Systems, Control and Robotics at the Royal
Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

About this time [two years ago]({% post_url 2011-09-04-packing %}), I posted
pretty much the same photo when I was leaving for Japan. I think I already knew
at that point that I wasn't really interested in staying in the UK after I'd
graduated, but I definitely wasn't sure where I was going to go.

At this point I'm a little apprehensive, since I'm flying out early to look for
somewhere to live. As I'm an EU student, I don't have to pay tuition fees, but I
don't get to stay in university accommodation. The accommodation situation in
Stockholm is, according to both the university's official manual and most places
on the internet, quite terrible, with multiple warnings about scams, and 3+ year
queues for student accommodation.

Still, I'm confident that I can find somewhere before the 2 weeks I have booked
up in hostels has passed. Where that confidence stems from, who knows. Maybe,
deep down, I'm an optimist.

As you may have heard, Elon Musk, the man behind Tesla and SpaceX, revealed his idea for a new mass transit system, the _Hyperloop_, on the [Tesla blog](http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/hyperloop) yesterday. In The 57 page [document](http://www.teslamotors.com/sites/default/files/blog_images/hyperloop-alpha.pdf) (which you should read), he states that "useful feedback is welcomed on aspects of the Hyperloop design", and so I thought I'd make a suggestion. Here's the email I sent to Elon.

Hi Elon,

I read your Hyperloop proposal with great interest, and applaud you for making the idea public and exposing it to more thorough scrutiny by those people who are interested. I hope that this will lead to refinement and improvement of your original proposal.

My suggestion relates to passenger safety. Most modes of public transport use predominantly forward-facing seats. Trains and buses have some rear-facing seats, but the majority are forward-facing. Most aircraft seats (apart from business class) are forward-facing as well.

In vehicles where you are in the driving position, facing forwards makes sense, to allow you to see what is in front (although I think that rear-facing driver seats could also be feasible by using a video feed from the front of the car). In those where you are a passenger, especially in mass transport systems, the direction in which you are facing seems entirely irrelevant, and so I believe that if there is a safety advantage to sitting facing one way instead of another, this should be exploited.

Although seatbelts are very effective, I think that rear-facing seats could have safety advantages, and this idea appears to be supported by various military transport vehicles. The RAF has apparently been using rear-facing seats in many of its transports since 1945, and page 27 of [this article](http://www.history.navy.mil/nan/backissues/1950s/1952/dec52.pdf) from Naval Aviation News suggests that "passengers in navy transport planes have ten-fold better chances of coming out of crashes alive, thanks to backward-facing seats".

I'm sure you are also aware that both the Apollo and Soyuz re-entry modules have seats facing the opposite direction to that of re-entry. These [two](http://papers.sae.org/821391/) [papers](http://www.cso.nato.int/Pubs/rdp.asp?RDP=AGARD-AG-221) suggest that rear-facing seats can significantly improve occupant safety. [This paper](http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_nov07/ADFHealth_8_2_76-81.pdf) by the Austrailan Department of Defence gives some numbers for increased tolerance to whole-body impacts for horizontal force vectors. A forward facing seat with a two-point harness, such as that on standard aircraft permits a tolerance of 15g, whereas a rear-facing seat with a head rest permits up to 40g - a quite significant increase. The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends that children are put in rear-facing seats until the age of 2. While the physiology of adults is different to that of children, this indicates that there are potential safety benefits to using rear-facing seats.

Although safety may be improved by the use of rear-facing seats, it is also important to consider the negative aspects. The Australian DoD paper lists some possible disadvantages:

- Increased seat weight
- Increased seat cost
- Disliked by passengers
- Possibility of increased motion sickness
- Increased risk of missile injury

The first two of these points come from the increased force on rear-facing seats. The paper calculates that in a forward-facing seat with a two-point restraint, the turning moment around the fulcrum is 109.8Nm, from the back rest. The rest of the force (from the rotation of the torso) is transferred from the restraint, directly to the fulcrum, which means that no rotational force is applied. In the rear-facing seat, all of the force from the torso is applied to the back rest, which results in a much larger turning moment of 4029.8Nm. The calculations assume a horizontal -16g inertial force, with the centre of torso mass (50kg) approximately 0.5m from the fulcrum, with a back rest weight of 2kg. This large increase in applied rotational force would likely require the strengthening of the attachment point between the back rest and the seat pan, likely increasing the cost of rear-facing seats compared to forward-facing ones.

The third point is contestable. According to a [report](http://www.trb.org/studies/idea/finalreports/transit/Transit38_Final_Report.pdf) by the Transport Research Bureau on rear-facing wheelchair accommodation on buses, only 20% (of 23 respondents to a survey) said that they would not want to use rear-facing accommodation. This [article](http://www.airspacemag.com/need-to-know/Need-to-Know-Aft-Facing-Seats.html) references a survey done by the navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, to which only a few of the 500 respondents had objections to rear-facing seats during experimentation with them. A survey with 3047 respondents at [The Age](http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/rearfacing-aircraft-seats-safer-20130711-2psdf.html) had 80% of respondents saying that they would sit in a rear-facing seat if it was safer.

The motion sickness issue needs further investigation, but I think that this is not likely to be a large problem since the tube is closed, so there will not be a large amount of visual input to indicate movement.

The issue of missile injury from loose objects in the cabin can be mitigated by stowing bags under seats, and minimising the number of loose objects that are in the cabin as standard. It is unlikely that anything can be done about passenger possessions causing such problems.

To conclude, I suggest that the Hyperloop should break from the use of forward-facing seats, and in line with clear indicators for improved safety safety, use rear-facing seats instead. You have stated that passenger safety is one of the most important things for the Hyperloop, and therefore I think that the potential benefits of rear-facing seats should be seriously considered.

Kind regards,

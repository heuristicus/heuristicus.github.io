As is characteristic, my entries on this blog have been practically non-existent since I came to Sweden, mainly because I am of the firm conviction that everyone has better things to do than read whatever I can write by mashing on my keyboard for a while. Nonetheless, I've come to the conclusion after a reading marathon of 50 books in less than four months, no doubt a subconscious attempt to escape reality, I should probably take advantage of the fact that this constitutes something that books are something which could conceivably write about.

That's not to say that I would write anything for anything other than selfish reasons. After I finish a book I usually give it a rating on Goodreads and add it to a list of books that I've read which I've been updating since some time in 2008. I don't care much for ratings because they contain almost no useful information, especially as literature is such a subjective thing (and yet you still tend to read books which have higher ratings. Hypocrite), but I do it in the hope that it might be useful later when I'm looking for other things to read. However, instead of being lazy and just clicking my mouse absentmindedly over some 5-point scale from "soul-destroyingly tedious" to "mind-envelopingy fantastic" after a couple of seconds of contemplation, I thought that actually writing something down to give my impressions of a book soon after I've read it (preferably before starting the next one) would be far more beneficial than just leaving behind a somewhat arbitrary number. I might even be able to compare my impressions if I read something more than once, which could be interesting. There's always the miniscule probability that someone else reads the review, and the even smaller chance that they actually find it interesting or useful.

As such I intend to make a small effort to write a short review of books that I read from now on, and also to put up ones about the books that I've read so far this year. No doubt this will mean that I'll have to re-read them because my memory of books is so bad, which means that that is less likely. Perhaps just some of the more memorable ones (which I've given higher ratings...) Of course, there will be no attempts at any sort of literary criticism, and at best it will be but a jumble of words which vaguely convey what I was thinking while I was reading, along with some context. It will hardly warrant the title of "review", but that's what I'll call them because I'm too lazy to come up with something more representative.

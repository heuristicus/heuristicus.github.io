It would probably not be an exaggeration to say that most people who have heard of George Orwell know him for *Nineteen Eighty-Four*, and possibly *Animal Farm*, and these are no doubt the books that get read as well. This was the same for me, until recently when I discovered through a combination of YouTube talks and Wikipedia articles (the fonts of most of my knowledge, shamefully), that Orwell was also a great essayist, known for his memorable opening sentences and uncomplicated yet incisive commentaries on numerous topics. I shall no doubt be reading more collections of his essays, but *Decline of the English Murder* is the first, and I enjoyed the experience.

*Good Bad Books* quite hilariously slags off some "good bad book authors", and you're agreeing and thinking that of course it's a much better idea to read some proper intellectual writers. Just then, Orwell makes some cutting remarks about these intellectual writers, to quite amusing effect.

> The greater part of what W. L. George wrote was shoddy rubbish ...

> Trollope has remained readable and Carlyle has not: with all his cleverness he had not even the wit to write in plain straightforward English.

He also mentions Arthur Conan Doyle ("Obviously outstanding") as one such good bad book author, which seems odd to me. I've not yet read any Sherlock Holmes, but it seems that it's quite well regarded even now. Even though my literary knowledge is scant at best, given that I've heard of some of the authors mentioned in this category and very few from the "intellectual" side, it seems as though Orwell's thesis that "sheer skill, or native grace, [...] may have more survival value than erudition or intellectual power" holds true to some extent.

An analysis of what the average Brit is interested in based on the contents of cheap magazines is found in *Boys' Weeklies*. After a rather drawn out description of what goes on in some specific examples aimed at young boys, he observes that these magazines likely have a not insignificant influence on the way the boys who read them think later on in life. 

> ... the large range of papers devoted to the movies and all more or less exploiting womenâ€™s legs ...

This essay was probably my least favourite, and no doubt it could have been made shorter by reducing the number of lines spent describing the rather inane contents of the magazines. Still, some points that are made in the piece can be mulled over for a little while.

In two short paragraphs of *Women's Twopenny Papers*, Orwell picks apart a letter received from a contributor to women's magazines as a response to the previous essay.

> The moral superiority of the poor is one of the deadliest forms of escapism the ruling class have evolved.

This is by far the shortest piece in the collection, but he nonetheless makes some very astute observations about the assumptions made in the letter.

In *The Art of Donald McGill*,  Orwell writes about comic postcards (which he says are invariably rude jokes of some kind or another), and one wonders where he is going to go with it. He ends up lamenting that "the corner of the human heart that they speak for might easily manifest itself in worse forms", mentioning that many lines in a similar vein of humour are also present in Shakespeare.

> Codes of law and morals, or religious systems, never have much room in them for a humorous view of life

The final essay, *Hop-Picking Diary*, is a detailed account of several weeks spent as a tramp in various places, including hop-picking. This, along with the first essay *Clink* makes one wonder what sort of a man Orwell was. Why would he spend over a month living as a tramp unless he really had to? What was his motivation behind getting himself drunk and going to prison, and then after being released trying to get in again using other methods? No doubt his other book *Down and Out in Paris and London* will shed some light on the tramping. He mentions that the procedure of going to prison was interesting, and a list of words that he heard for the first time during his time as a tramp is also included. It seems as though he goes very far out of his way to try and experience the things that a specific subset of people experiences.

Throughout the collection, Orwell's writing is unflowery and to the point, and it certainly makes the points he is trying to make very well. Unfortunately I don't know any other essayists against whom I could compare his work, but standing alone it was a good read, and issues were raised about which I had not previously thought. I look forward to reading some more of Orwell's less widely known work.

I don't remember exactly in what context I first discovered Sam Harris, but I'm sure that it was at some point during a period in which I watched a lot of YouTube videos of debates centring on religion. The same few names come up rather often in this context, namely Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and Sam Harris, who are sometimes referred to as The Four Horsemen of New Atheism. All four of them had books published some time around 2006 which dealt with the religion question from different perspectives based on their respective areas of experience. The term new atheism to me is a little ridiculous because for the most part (as they admit), their ideas are hardly "new", being traceable at least in part to Hume, Russell and other prominent thinkers of previous centuries. Of course, the perspective has changed due to societal shifts and increases in scientific knowledge, but at their most basic, the ideas are the same. Anyway, this is Harris' second book on the topic, the purpose of which he describes thus:

> In *Letter to a Christian Nation*, I have set out to demolish the intellectual and moral pretensions of Christianity in its most committed forms.

An admirable goal if ever there was one, but even before one starts reading it's quite obvious that it is unlikely that any committed Christian will be responsive to the arguments, however convincing they are to someone already on Harris' side. The arguments are dispensed with in one dubious and irrational way or another, and no progress whatsoever is made. Nonetheless, it is a good resource with which to inform oneself of some of the main arguments that can be brought to bear against the stance of the committed Christian, and can no doubt be applied with relatively few modifications to any religion of your choosing. Harris defines the target for his arguments as those people who believe "that the Bible is the inspired word of God and that only those who accept the divinity of Jesus Christ will experience salvation after death." To me this seems like it would be a rather narrow category, but given that the letter is to the USA, it is wider than one would think --- apparently over 50% of Americans believe something along these lines; or at least they say they do.

The book is rather short at a little over 50 pages, each subsection dealing neatly with a different argument.

>CONSIDER: every devout Muslim has the same reasons for being a Muslim that you have for being a Christian. And yet you do not find their reasons compelling.

The first section deals with the wisdom of the Bible, and Harris demolishes the idea that it is a good basis for morality, simply by taking some passages from the text and pointing out their utter absurdity in a modern (and indeed any) context. He calls into question the idea that many Christians appear to have that in the New Testament Jesus somehow discards the Old Testament writings, which contain a lot of the passages of fire and brimstone, slavery and misogyny, and points out that Jesus' teachings aren't much better in many cases anyway. I am reminded of the poor fig tree. He also points out that the golden rule, held up by many as one of the great teachings of Jesus, was around for at least half a century before Jesus is supposed to have showed up. Harris claims (and I agree) that the ten commandments are hardly a good encapsulation of morality.

> Mahavira, the Jain patriarch, surpassed the morality of the Bible with a single sentence: “Do not injure, abuse, oppress, enslave, insult, torment, torture, or kill any creature or living being.”

Sure, Jains also believe some ridiculous things, but as a central tenet that one looks pretty good to me --- certainly a lot better than the ten commandments.

After dispensing with the Bible's morality, Harris introduces his atheistic conception of morality, based on human well-being, which I believe he expands on in *The Moral Landscape*. Here he deals with Christianity's obsession with sex and the effect this has on increasing suffering, as well as the various fallacies that are committed by people who believe that stem cell research is morally atrocious based on some idea that a three-day old embryo has a soul or is somehow human. It's obvious to me, at least, that to *not* pursue the avenues opened by stem cell research is more immoral, but that's another debate altogether.

For me at least, it's very difficult to disagree with anything that Harris writes. Sure, if one was so inclined it would no doubt be possible to pick holes in some of his more philosophical arguments, but it's far harder to do that than it is to obsolete the Christian arguments entirely --- at least from the point of view of anyone capable of some semblance of rational thinking. The subsequent sections deal with most other positions that Christians hold. Rather than treating each individually, I'll just comment on a couple of the more memorable parts of the discussion. Hopefully I can manage more than just "Oh, I agree with this too."

> On a day when over one hundred thousand children were simultaneously torn from their mothers’ arms and casually drowned, liberal theology must stand revealed for what it is: the sheerest of mortal pretenses.

While Harris believes rightly that both positions are abhorrent, the idea that the Asian tsunami was a manifestation of God's wrath makes more sense than does the one which many liberal or moderate Christians hold; that God is simply to be a source of consolation. It's clear to me that anyone who can possibly reconcile the fact that God is supposed to be omnipotent and omniscient with and allows events of such abject horror, pain and misery has had their morality skewed to an almost absurd degree. This is of course the age-old problem of evil, the answer to which "Sophisticated Theologians" have utterly failed to produce (this assumes that they can produce anything at all of value), and to which most average Christians probably have no answer either.

> An atheist is a person who believes that the murder of a single little girl—even once in a million years—casts doubt upon the idea of a benevolent God.

Indeed, many lesser crimes should cause many people to reconsider their position. And yet few do, ignoring the existence of the absurd and pointless suffering of millions around the world. Many others, atheists included, also ignore these things, but the idea that an omnipotent being who could make it all go away exists but can't be bothered, or something, probably isn't one of their core beliefs. There is complacency among those of us who have little to complain about, myself included, but I hope that at least we are heading in the right direction by believing that it's theoretically in our power to do something about it.

> It is time we recognized the boundless narcissism and self-deceit of the saved. It is time we acknowledged how disgraceful it is for the survivors of a catastrophe to believe themselves spared by a loving God, while this same God drowned infants in their cribs.

This is another example of the kind of things that the religious do which I still can't get my head around. Some would probably make the excuse that it's the devil that is doing these evil things, but that's a weak excuse for God. There are a practically infinite number of places where this kind of ridiculous thinking could be, and is, applied. Your child got through chemotherapy and probably won't die --- thank God. But why not "thank" him for giving your child cancer and crippling them in the first place. Wouldn't it be better if it had never happened? The answer is of course a resounding "Yes!" A typical example of cherry-picking the good bits which never ceases to diminish purely human achievements. Some people thank God for their various sporting, academic and business achievements, when they should be proud of their own efforts towards those goals.

> You are using your own moral intuitions to authenticate the wisdom of the Bible—and then, in the next moment, you assert that we human beings cannot possibly rely upon our own intuitions to rightly guide us in the world; rather, we must depend upon the prescriptions of the Bible. You are using your own moral intuitions to decide that the Bible is the appropriate guarantor of your moral intuitions. Your own intuitions are still primary, and your reasoning is circular.

Again, probably something that most Christians don't really think about. But even this counter-argument is somehow discarded.

>While believing strongly, without evidence, is considered a mark of madness or stupidity in any other area of our lives, faith in God still holds immense prestige in our society. Religion is the one area of our discourse where it is considered noble to pretend to be certain about things no human being could possibly be certain about. It is telling that this aura of nobility extends only to those faiths that still have many subscribers. Anyone caught worshipping Poseidon, even at sea, will be thought insane.

The disproportionate prestige that religion in general holds is something that I and many others find so troubling. Not, as so many people would say, because we want to attack it without any consequences, but because it still holds a position that it is not possible to attack without receiving absurd responses, usually including the words "faith" and "sacred", which make reasonable discourse impossible. As many have said, there is no idea other than religion about which one cannot express an opinion without being (sometimes literally) beaten down.

> There is, in fact, no worldview more reprehensible in its arrogance than that of a religious believer: the creator of the universe takes an interest in me, approves of me, loves me, and will reward me after death; my current beliefs, drawn from scripture, will remain the best statement of the truth until the end of the world; everyone who disagrees with me will spend eternity in hell.... An average Christian, in an average church, listening to an average Sunday sermon has achieved a level of arrogance simply unimaginable in scientific discourse--and there have been some extraordinarily arrogant scientists.

Probably my favourite excerpt. Especially the last sentence.

> One of the enduring pathologies of human culture is the tendency to raise children to fear and demonize other human beings on the basis of religious faith.

This encompasses another of my major objections to religions. Not only do they impede critical consideration of many topics, they also encourage the formation of groups, which inevitably results in divisions, and of course conflicts. The eradication of religion would not solve this problem, but I have the feeling that at least at that point there might actually be better reasons for conflicts than something along the lines of "The God you believe in is the wrong one!" or "Your interpretation this ancient book is wrong!", which are patently absurd.

To conclude, the book is a compact package which dismantles the main arguments used by Christians, and it does so with Harris' usual clarity and conciseness, which makes it all the more devastating. A good tool with which to get a short overview of the counter-arguments.

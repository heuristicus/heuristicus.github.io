  <h2>Flight and First impressions</h2>
  Sep 06, 2011 <br>

  <section class="postcontent">
    <p>I was the first to reach the boarding gate, which was nice. I spent a while trying to photograph random people in the departures area, but since that didn&rsquo;t go well I decided to get some of inanimate objects - much easier. I ended up walking past someone with a notice with my flight number on it, so I ran off to the gate, assuming that loads of people will have already got there. I actually managed to beat the air hostesses to the gate as well.</p>

<p><img src="http://okkeio.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_9463.jpg" alt="I got told off for taking photos shortly after taking this." /></p>

<p>The flight was pretty uneventful. I managed to get probably an hour&rsquo;s sleep, even though I was trying to sleep for pretty much the whole 11 hours. Lunch was OK, I got the &ldquo;Japanese Bento&rdquo; (as if there&rsquo;s any other type). Too much wasabi on the soba, but still pretty decent. Breakfast was a pretty terrible attempt at English breakfast, but I guess it&rsquo;s about as much as you can expect from aeroplane food.</p>

<p>Arriving in Japan, I had my fingerprints scanned and a photo taken, which was interesting. Hiroki was at the airport to meet me, which helped greatly, since I didn&rsquo;t have to try too much to navigate the train system. We headed for Shibuya, where we intended to have some noodles. The train journey was rather interesting. I was able to see loads of things that often come up in anime and TV shows in Japan. The high banked grassy slopes next to rivers with a path on top, cicadas, rail crossings (about 5 in a one and a half hour journey, with the noise and all), the nice font that is used on signs in train stations, and cicadas. I also got to see a good few of the types of people who travel on the trains in Japan - An OL (office lady), plenty of businessmen, and some schoolgirls (who laughed when I ruffled my hair - I assume it took on an interesting shape. They laughed at a hell of a lot of things, actually). I also had a little experience of one of the worse (or better, depending on how you see it) parts of being a foreigner in Japan, when a couple were blatantly heading for the two seats next to me, but when they noticed I was sitting there did an about turn and sat in another part of the carriage. Oh well, better get used to it.</p>

<p><img src="http://okkeio.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/img_9489.jpg" alt="I was rather underwhelmed by this apparently massive crossroads. I think it might be because it was a Tuesday at 1, so there weren't really any crowds." /></p>

<p>Once in Shibuya, we waited for Nozomi, who eventually appeared, and went to get some ramen. It was pretty good, although I have nothing to compare it to at the moment. After that, we went to Hiyoshi and found the place where I&rsquo;ll be staying for the next year or so. Checking in was pretty easy. The room I&rsquo;m in is small, but pretty good as things go. I have my own bathroom, a bed, a desk and some cupboards. That&rsquo;s about all that is necessary, and maybe a even a little more. After unpacking (read: throwing all my stuff onto the bed), we went back to Hiyoshi station to get some basic foodstuffs and crockery. The 100 yen shop turned out to be pretty good, albeit not having any forks or spoons other than &ldquo;dessert&rdquo; versions, and the only knife to be found was a steak knife. Nonetheless, I came away with a rice bowl, miso soup bowl, plate, 2 forks, chopsticks, cooking chopsticks and 6 hangers for Â¥945. Got some rice and curry ingredients to tide me over until I can find ingredients that I can make stuff with/learn to make Japanese food. What I really needed, though, was shampoo, I think. Sitting on a flight and then stepping into 30 degree heat with crazy humidity without being used to it at all means that one sweats rather a lot. Mission for tomorrow: find out how and where to get an alien registration card, buy some shampoo. I&rsquo;m writing in the dark at the moment, because there is a counter which shows how much money you have left for electricity and water, and it makes me want to use as little as possible. More on that later, if I remember.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not feeling comfortable right now, probably because I&rsquo;ve been thrust into the middle of things with relatively little preparation. Given that I can speak Japanese quite well, I can&rsquo;t imagine how it feels for people who don&rsquo;t speak the language at all. One of the worst things at the moment is that I don&rsquo;t really have a clue what sort of things I can get where, even though I know that generally I can probably make a stir fry from anything. And suddenly, my ability to speak Japanese when it&rsquo;s to people that I don&rsquo;t know drops to near zero. These things might all be due to the fact that I haven&rsquo;t slept for over 24 hours to try and get over jet lag as quickly as possible, so we&rsquo;ll see how things are in a few days.</p>

<p>One thing I know for sure - I&rsquo;m actually in Japan.</p>

  <h2>Shinjuku and Tests</h2>
  Sep 17, 2011 <br>

  <section class="postcontent">
    <p>I went to Shinjuku today intending to buy a tripod so that I can take some night shots. Ended up looking in two massive electronics shops. One of them (Yodobashi camera) is so huge that it has various buildings for different types of electronics. There was a five floor building entirely centered on camera stuff, but I ended up not finding a tripod that I wanted. As often happens, I ended up walking around for a bit, and took a few photographs. Nothing particularly interesting, but oh well. After wandering a little I stumbled upon a Uniqlo, and had a look just in case they had offers on some things. Luckily, they had slippers for 790 yen odd, which was nice. Not sure if I really need them that much, but a lot of people in Japan use slippers when walking around in their house, since outdoor shoes are left in the genkan (entrance). After that, I went back to Shibuya to take the train back to Hiyoshi, and noticed that there was a part of the platform on the other side that had quite a good view of the Shinjuku crossing without a window or anything in the way, although I had to lean over a &ldquo;no entry&rdquo; gate to get pictures without a fence in the way. Ended up getting only one presentable shot, but I think I&rsquo;ll go back there when the crossing is at its most chaotic, at night, and get a slightly more atmospheric, and hopefully better, shot.</p>

<p>The past week was exciting, in a very loose sense of the word. We had a placement test to split us into groups based on Japanese ability level. Some parts of the test were pretty tough, but I was expecting it to be like that since they have twelve levels to split students into, and the top levels are for people with pretty much native level Japanese. What they&rsquo;re doing taking a Japanese course, I have no idea. At any rate, I ended up in level 7, which is quite a lot higher than I expected.</p>

<p>I was told that I scored the worst in the writing test of everyone in my level, but I&rsquo;m not really surprised. Most of the later questions I pretty much guessed, since I didn&rsquo;t have any clue what the grammar structure was. For example, &ldquo;〜ざるを得ない&rdquo; seems to be an archaic grammar structure which expresses something which must be done. I must have made up for my low mark in the writing in the other tests though, since I ended up in this level. Most people who are on this course seem to be taking Japanese as the main part of their course, so I feel as if things are a little unfair, but I guess it&rsquo;s about time I got a feeling of what it&rsquo;s like to be at the bottom of the class. We&rsquo;re apparently having another test next week to make sure that we are in the right class, so I think I&rsquo;m going to have to study a little bit to make sure I can stay here. I don&rsquo;t really feel like moving down, since at this level I&rsquo;m very close to the advanced level, which means that I&rsquo;ll have to move up to the pre-advanced classes next semester, since we&rsquo;re not allowed to do the core modules at the same level that we did before. If I move down to level 6 then I might end up only getting to level 7 by the next semester, which would be rather disappointing. I plan to try and reverse any decision to move me down a level based on the fact that I prefer working on things that are too difficult than things which are too easy. Don&rsquo;t know how well that will go down, though.</p>

<p>The homework we were given in the introduction session, although not particularly interesting, is far better than the ones that I&rsquo;ve become used to from Birmingham&rsquo;s Japanese department. There are kanji I don&rsquo;t know, which is fun, and I actually have to think about what to write down rather than it coming to me straight away. If it continues this way then this year will definitely be fruitful.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re able to make various choices on modules for this semester. We have six core modules (基本科目), and then we can choose one or more modules from subjects with a specific focus (技能別科目), Japanese cultural modules (日本文化科目). There are also modules from other disciplines such as economics and linguistics and so forth which we can choose from, which are taught in English. When I was at the short interview with the supervisors, they were rather surprised that I already had a list of the modules that I was interested in taking written down. Seems normal to me, but I guess not everyone is as obsessed about planning as I am. I&rsquo;ve tentatively decided to study intermediate orthography (kanji), intermediate grammar, intermediate conversation, intermediate or advanced aural comprehension and intermediate modern text reading.</p>

<p>Orthography teaches another 250 kanji to people who already know around 500, which is pretty the number that I&rsquo;ve studied properly. I can recognise and read probably around 150-200 more from reading manga and watching Japanese TV, but that might be an over-exaggeration. I was advised against taking this, since we will apparently learn a lot of kanji in the core classes. We were also told that we should know around 1100 kanji at this level, but I think that&rsquo;s a bit over the top, since four of thirteen people in my class knew around 700.</p>

<p>Grammar contains work on structures from level N2 of the JLPT, so I thought that&rsquo;d be useful to take. I was recommended to go and have a look at the lower level class as well (most classes have several levels. For example grammar has levels I, II and III, of increasing difficulty. I&rsquo;ve opted to take the most difficult class in each level, because why not?), since it might match my level better. If it turns out that the level is too high, then I might drop down to level II, but that means that I&rsquo;ll have to decide whether to take this class or the conversation class, since they clash. Apparently grammar is studied quite a lot in the core classes as well, so it might not be necessary to take this class, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/6154640823"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6074/6154640823_7c5db45369_b.jpg" alt="forbidden" /></a></p>

<p>Conversation is pretty self explanatory, just thought about taking it in case it would actually have some use. Whether I take it or not depends on the content of the class. It could be useful, but I can pretty much get by with normal conversation.</p>

<p>Aural comprehension is again self explanatory. Listening is my strongest point, so maybe I should concentrate on taking classes in something that I&rsquo;m not very good at (writing), but I feel like I might as well take advantage of being reasonably good at listening so that I can improve even more.</p>

<p>Modern text reading is about reading modern novels and stuff, I suppose. I&rsquo;m not really sure how useful this will be, since I don&rsquo;t really like reading novels - just science literature all the time. There&rsquo;s no class for that, so this is probably the best thing to do. It teaches stuff on grammar understanding and the like, so I guess it&rsquo;s a good way to cement knowledge. There&rsquo;s another course in newspaper reading, but if Japanese newspapers are anything at all like British newspapers, then I couldn&rsquo;t care less about the content. Then again, I do watch anime and TV shows with pretty much no substance whatsoever from time to time just to practice Japanese &hellip;</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re able to have a look at classes without signing up for them throughout next week, so I&rsquo;m going to go and have a look at all the classes that I&rsquo;ve written down and then decide from there.</p>

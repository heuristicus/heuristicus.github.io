    <p>Been waking up at 4am, jet lag seems to be persisting despite my efforts to get rid of it as quickly as possible. Stuff is going pretty well. I&rsquo;ve got a phone and a bank account, and a 定期券 (teikiken), which lets me travel on a specific route on the metro for quite a lot cheaper than just paying the normal fare. I go from 日吉 (Hiyoshi) to 田町 (Tamachi) via 渋谷 (Shibuya). We&rsquo;ve had some orientation stuff, filling in a load of forms. Forms for absolutely everything here. Two for the bank, two for the phone, two for accommodation check-in, and another 6 or so for various things to do with Keio. Met a few people as well, although mostly exchange students, which isn&rsquo;t particularly what I&rsquo;m interested in. I also had my first crowded train experience on the way to Shibuya. Not really had time to go anywhere to take photos, but hopefully I&rsquo;ll get the chance to go during the weekend and take a few.</p>

    <p>Today I went to Shinjuku to go up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Metropolitan_Government_Building">Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building</a>. I don&rsquo;t know what I was expecting really, it was pretty much exactly like all other photos of Tokyo from skyscrapers. I had a go at taking a few interesting photographs, but I don&rsquo;t think it went very well. Not to worry, I spent about 500 yen the whole day, so at least it was cheap. I walked to Yoyogi from Shinjuku, and passed through Meiji shrine on the way. I guess it could be called impressive, but it didn&rsquo;t really strike me as that fantastic. Probably didn&rsquo;t help that they were building the stage for some event. Yoyogi park was insanely packed. The Harajuku gate had loads of 30-40 year old people doing various forms of dancing to rock songs which I&rsquo;d never heard before, and inside the park there were loads of people out with families/friends/people of some relation doing various things. Badminton, digeridoos, drums, band practices and juggling were a few of the activities that I noticed. Today&rsquo;s pictures can be found <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/archives/date-posted/2011/10/09/">here</a>. Or, have a look <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/">here</a> for everything.</p>

<p>Been pretty busy, and therefore had little time to update. I&rsquo;ve had the weekend off, Monday is a national holiday and Tuesday I have no lectures, so I might write something (very) long in the near future.</p>

photo, Photo, and walking

Today I went to Shinjuku to go up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Metropolitan_Government_Building">Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building</a>. I don't know what I was expecting really, it was pretty much exactly like all other photos of Tokyo from skyscrapers. I had a go at taking a few interesting photographs, but I don't think it went very well. Not to worry, I spent about 500 yen the whole day, so at least it was cheap. I walked to Yoyogi from Shinjuku, and passed through Meiji shrine on the way. I guess it could be called impressive, but it didn't really strike me as that fantastic. Probably didn't help that they were building the stage for some event. Yoyogi park was insanely packed. The Harajuku gate had loads of 30-40 year old people doing various forms of dancing to rock songs which I'd never heard before, and inside the park there were loads of people out with families/friends/people of some relation doing various things. Badminton, digeridoos, drums, band practices and juggling were a few of the activities that I noticed. Today's pictures can be found <a title="here" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/archives/date-posted/2011/10/09/" target="_blank">here</a>. Or <a title="here" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/" target="_blank">here</a>Â for everything.

Been pretty busy, and therefore had little time to update. I've had the weekend off, Monday is a national holiday and Tuesday I have no lectures, so I might write something (very) long in the near future.

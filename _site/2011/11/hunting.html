interviews, Japan, part-time, students, Work, and work
<br>
With the economy being as it is, I have decided that the amount of money graciously provided by the British taxpayer will not be sufficient if I am to make full use of the time that I have here in Japan. As such, I've decided to look for part time jobs so that I have some money to actually go and see some places which aren't just urban sprawls (and of course buy nice things).

Begin braindump.

The average university student in Japan is a very interesting creature. From what I have been able to observe from a relatively small sample size, there are large differences between UK and Japanese students. For me, the thing that stands out most is perhaps the effort that a lot of students go through to go to university. In the UK, the furthest you'd reasonably expect someone to live from the university is around 30 minutes, and even that is pushing it (I can talk, having lived about 30 minutes on foot from the university last year...). At any rate, it seems like students are on the same level as commuters, at least in the big cities. Since most universities in places like Tokyo and Osaka are very limited in terms of space, most students are unable to live close to universities due to high rent, and perhaps other reasons. Taking this into account, it is not particularly surprising that a lot of students commute an hour or so each way to get to university. I also believe that the percentage of students who live with their parents is also quite different to that of the UK, but I don't have any hard evidence. Another thing that rather surprised me is the time until which students stay on campus. One of the Japanese students at the dormitory that I am staying in had a seminar that finished at around 9:30pm. This might be an exceptional case for a specific subject, similar to medicine in the UK, I suppose. There seem to be large disparities in the lecturing hours of students, but again I suppose that this is a case of courses being different. It seems that here the main struggle is to actually get into a good university - once you're in, it's pretty easy to leave with some form of qualification that will actually be useful. If you manage to get into a university with a good reputation, then your chances of getting a decent job also increase. So, in the end, it seems as thought it's your own choice whether you actually work hard or not. Well, it's the same in the UK to some extent, but at least if you want to have any chance of passing you have to actually do some work. Over here, a rather large percentage of the marks for a course are assigned purely on whether you turn up for lectures - a lot of students show up and promptly go to sleep. With this abundance of spare time, a significant number of students have part time jobs with which they support whatever lifestyle they decide to lead (inevitably drinking rather a lot, and probably going to karaoke.)

I congratulate you if you got anything out of the above paragraph. Anyway, given that the part-time job seems to be an important part of university life, I decided to try my hand at getting one. My first attempt was a second-hand book shop, Book Off, which is really awesome. Perhaps it warrants its own post at some point, although the likelihood of me getting round to that is small. At any rate, I applied through their online system, only to be told that they do not accept foreigners who don't have JLPT N1 under their belt (significantly more politely than that though). Rather a blow, but whatever, it's their company. Next, I tried out for Uniqlo, another shop that I know relatively well. I called them up and asked whether they hire foreigners, and it seemed as though no real qualifications were necessary, as long as you can speak Japanese. I arranged an interview for the next Thursday, and had a hunt for potential interview questions on the web. I vaguely prepared some bullet points on questions that I thought were likely to come up. I got one of the questions right, but if they didn't ask that one (why do you want to work here?) then it'd have been rather odd. I was asked about teamwork experience, and how I helped the team work together and reach a final goal. Took me rather by surprise, and I floundered around trying to explain about my experience with the Robot Club at Birmingham, which didn't go very well (the explanation, not the club). After that, another unexpected question came up - how do you go about making sure that customers leave the shop satisfied. Again, I managed to blab some stuff about them finding what they were looking for, and being served by polite staff, but it was a complete mess, even from my perspective, so I can't imagine how stupid the interviewer thought I was. It was pretty impossible to tell what the interviewer was thinking, but I realised pretty quickly after the interview ended that I'd be incredibly lucky to get the job after that performance.

On Monday, I was in Book Off, buying more books (apparently used, but for all intents and purposes, pretty much new) for 85p. I'd noticed before that they still had signs up stating that they were recruiting part-timers, so I decided to ask the person at the till if they would take on foreigners (again). I got the same answer as before, and got an interview set for Thursday. I decided that I'd prepare a little better this time, and actually wrote out what I was planning to say for each of my predicted questions. I ended up with around a page, and read it to myself out loud a few times to get it into my head a little. When taking down the interview time, I forgot to check the actual date, so I wasn't sure whether it was this Thursday or next Thursday, but I had some sort of vague faith in my Japanese ability so I went in today. I'm not sure if I was right or not, but I guess I was, because after hanging around for 10 minutes or so (timing is very precise. I arrived at the Uniqlo interview 3 minutes or so before the specified time, and was told to come back when it was time), the interviewer arrived and took me to a very tiny room with some people on computers in it. I handed over my rirekisho, which is similar to a CV, but is standard for everyone. You get very little room to write anything about yourself, and the only other section is school and work history. Anyway, this time things went a lot better, at least from my point of view. I answered the "why do you want to work here" question much better this time, and was also asked about which manga I liked, since I said that I visit the shop pretty much every week to buy manga. I was then asked whether I had taken JLPT, and since I haven't taken it yet, replied with that. After that I was asked if I had any questions, so I vaguely asked where they get most of their stock from, and what sort of regulations there are on work clothing, and then the interview was over. My phone number was taken down, and then I got my rirekisho back, which seemed odd, since Uniqlo kept the one that I brought to that interview. Perhaps this is an obvious pointer that I didn't pass. I didn't quite catch what was said when I was given it back. From the abruptness of the transfer from the JLPT question and questions from me, I can only assume that I've failed a second time, but I was told that I'd know by tomorrow whether I had the job, via standard procedure - a call if I get it, nothing at all if I don't.

Even though I'd like to have some money to spend, I might just give up now, since it seems difficult to get a job as a foreigner in a place where a reasonable portion is interaction with customers. Why hire someone whose Japanese is mediocre at best, when even the stupidest Japanese person has a higher skill level than me. My level is probably equivalent to children just leaving primary school, which is slightly depressing, but oh well. Also, having to work is obviously a drain on time that I need for study, although in all honesty I probably have too much spare time, and am just wasting it mindlessly browsing the same sites as usual. Then again, with no money, I can't do anything in my spare time, since going anywhere costs money. If I want to leave Tokyo at some point then it's going to cost me a reasonable amount of money. Dilemmas, dilemmas. I could always dig into my savings, but at the moment I don't really feel as if it's really worth it.

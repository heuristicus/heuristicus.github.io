  <h2>A Good Day</h2>
  Dec 13, 2011 <br>

  <section class="postcontent">
    <p>Today, I have had a Good Day. Yes, with capital letters.</p>

<p>Started off with the usual lessons, where we did nothing particularly interesting, but it was enjoyable as usual. After that, I had a 5 hour break before I had my second shift at work. I spent a while contemplating what to do, and eventually decided to go to Shibuya, which is where I always go when I want to go somewhere and can&rsquo;t really think of anywhere. Hung around the Book Off, hunting for books in the 105 section, but didn&rsquo;t find anything new. Had a look around the used clothes shop on the bottom floor (which is quite good, although not actually that much cheaper than buying retail. Uniqlo and that other shop&hellip;H&amp;M are probably cheaper.) decided I didn&rsquo;t have enough money to spend on anything new, and couldn&rsquo;t really be bothered to look through tons of stuff to find something nice.</p>

<p>I decided to head home and have a nap, but ended up attempting to cook some meat with some peppers and various Japanese condiments, but it came out very average. I also discovered that the bottom shelf of my fridge is a freezer, and not split into a freezer and fridge. This resulted in the peppers being interesting to cut, and some rather brown bananas. I headed back to work (total time spent commuting today: 4 hours). Even though it was only my second real day on the job, I think I&rsquo;m getting used to things pretty quickly. My use of words may not be sufficiently polite at times, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m still making mistakes, but I took quite a few orders, and served plenty more people than before. I also learned (not really an appropriate word, but it&rsquo;ll have to do) how to change the grille on the brazier used to cook the meat, and how to clean up tables after customers have left. I got asked a few questions by some salarymen, and ended up talking to two guys for 5 minutes or so after I&rsquo;d delivered them their tea. If things keep going this way, I might actually have a chance to use more Japanese than I thought I would, but the scope of conversation is rather limited. Nonetheless, I was pleased that someone went out of their way to talk to me. I also learned that I can&rsquo;t guess people&rsquo;s age, unless it&rsquo;s really obvious. I thought my 17 year old co-worker was a university student, which she seemed pleased about. Thinking about it now, aren&rsquo;t people of the female persuasion supposed to be annoyed when you guess their age above what it actually is? Perhaps it&rsquo;s different for high school students.</p>

<p>My shift finished, and I was rather tired after standing for 4 hours straight. Given my usual sedentary lifestyle sitting in front of a computer screen in a not-particularly-comfortable chair for 12+ hours a day, this is not really surprising. I got home, and decided to check my emails, and there was one from Keio. For a moment I disregarded it as some more information about something I wasn&rsquo;t particularly interested in, but I read it anyway. I was rather surprised to find that I had been selected as a recipient of the additional allocation JASSO scholarship, whatever that may mean. Whatever it means, the key point is that I have been allocated this scholarship for three months. The JASSO scholarship was something that we could apply for during the application period for the study abroad year, and of course I went for it, because why the hell not. It&rsquo;s a scholarship from the Japanese government (who seem to really like handing out money to foreign people, even though they seem to dislike them rather a lot [see: JET]), which gives a monthly stipend of ï¿¥80,000. Some students get this for the whole study abroad period, but I don&rsquo;t think that anyone from Birmingham has received it. I&rsquo;m rather pleased to get this, since the current state of the pound/yen is massively in the favour of the yen at the moment (i.e. the pound is terrible), and it will mean that at least I can feel a little bit more free about spending some money. Also, a scholarship is a nice thing to put on my CV, even though I can&rsquo;t even remember why it&rsquo;s awarded (I seem to remember it being randomly chosen, but that is surely incorrect).</p>

<p>Maybe today wasn&rsquo;t a good day after all. I&rsquo;m inexperienced in experiencing good days, so I can&rsquo;t tell.</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>

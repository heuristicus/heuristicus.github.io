  <h2><a href="/2012/02/its-been-a-while.html">It's been a while...</a></h2>
  24 Feb 2012
  ...and nothing much has happened. What follows is a report that I wrote in order to fulfil a requirement of my scholarship. It's pretty rough, as I didn't bother reading through after I'd written it. Since the limit was a page, I couldn't really go into depth on anything, but since I wrote it I thought I may as well put it up here as I haven't written anything for a while.

In this short report, I intend to detail a few of my experiences in Japan, and also to discuss my what I think of the country after spending more or less half a year studying at Keio University. With another 4 months left here it is possible that I will discover that my opinions on some things that I discuss here change. However, I write this with reasonable confidence that the assumptions I make are not entirely unfounded.
I had been told that the Japanese summer is hot, but was not particularly concerned, since heat can be easily tolerated by sitting in the shade somewhere. Or so I thought. The first thing that surprised me a little as I arrived in Japan at the beginnning of September was the humidity. There was nowhere I could hide from its ever-present sweat-inducing heat. Given that I had arrived only a few months after the Touhoku earthquake, a lot of Tokyo was in power-saving mode, and so even if there was air conditioning, it was not being used. While enduring the humidity, I travelled into the centre of Tokyo, taking a train through rural Chiba prefecture. The difference between the start and end point of the journey was quite striking--- mostly open fields in Chiba, gradually transforming into the high-rise concrete jungle of Tokyo. I have grown used to advertisements, having lived in London for most of my life, but the scale in Tokyo was on a completely different level. It seemed as thought almost any space that could be seen from the train had some billboard advertising some product or other, or if not, the name of the company which owned the building.
Having been conditioned to Japan through anime, friends and my occasional viewing of Japanese TV programmes, as well as looking at a lot of photographs, I was not overwhelmed by anything in particular, and have not at this point experienced anything which I feel can be said to be culture shock. If anything, I have grown to like Tokyo, with its extensive train network and the ease of access to any product that you may be looking for. I would have liked to take advantage of this, but at the time of writing, economic climate means that the yen is almost prohibitively expensive. Not one to give up, I quickly discovered that Japanese second-hand shops are fantastic places to find things. In the UK there are many second hand shops, but the quality of the products is often far below that of anything that you could buy new. In contrast, the vast majority of used products in Japan seem to be in extremely good shape. A second hand bicycle I bought was to me indistinguishable from a new one. Second hand books and manga are in the majority of cases in very good condition (and very cheap, to boot). The are also many second hand clothes shops, and given the Japanese interest obsession with fashion, you will not be hard pressed to find a set of stylish clothing for a relatively small price.
The most obvious difference that I have seen so far is the method of teaching that seems to be very common here. In the UK, and from what I have heard, the US as well, students are taught to think for themselves and come up with their own explanations of whatever they are being taught, if it is possible to do so. In my experience, this generally works well, although of course it depends a lot on both the student and the teacher. I accept that there are many problems with the education system of the UK, but the teaching methods in Japan are, to me, rather odd. It seems as though the basis for most learning is memorisation. This is not surprising, since the Japanese writing system essentially requires the memorisation of two thousand or so characters. However, for me, this does not mean that rote memorisation should be used to learn other things as well. I was lucky enough to not have had to do much of it because of the class that I was put into, but friends have told me that much of their lessons and homework consisted of rote memorisation of long passages of text. We discussed this in our class for a while, and were assured that the students in classes using mostly memorisation progress just as much as those who focus on other methods, but I am somewhat doubtful of the validity of this statement, at least for myself personally. I find that once the exam or whatever other thing I have memorised something for is over, I forget everything extremely quickly. In my opinion, understanding of something is gained at a relatively slow pace, purely through exposure to the same general concept in many different contexts. This is probably why native speakers are so good at speaking their language---they have had a lot of time to learn the nuances of words, phrases and so on, and when they can be used.
This year so far has been a very interesting one. Meeting people whose interests and field of study are completely different from mine, being immersed in a foreign culture, studying a language full-time, finding a part-time job in a country whose language I have yet to master, and having the opportunity to think about questions that I would probably not have considered of much importance if I had been asked only a few months ago.

  <h2><a href="/2011/12/a-good-day.html">A Good Day</a></h2>
  13 Dec 2011
  Today, I have had a Good Day. Yes, with capital letters.

Started off with the usual lessons, where we did nothing particularly interesting, but it was enjoyable as usual. After that, I had a 5 hour break before I had my second shift at work. I spent a while contemplating what to do, and eventually decided to go to Shibuya, which is where I always go when I want to go somewhere and can't really think of anywhere. Hung around the Book Off, hunting for books in the 105 section, but didn't find anything new. Had a look around the used clothes shop on the bottom floor (which is quite good, although not actually that much cheaper than buying retail. Uniqlo and that other shop...H&amp;M are probably cheaper.) decided I didn't have enough money to spend on anything new, and couldn't really be bothered to look through tons of stuff to find something nice.

I decided to head home and have a nap, but ended up attempting to cook some meat with some peppers and various Japanese condiments, but it came out very average. I also discovered that the bottom shelf of my fridge is a freezer, and not split into a freezer and fridge. This resulted in the peppers being interesting to cut, and some rather brown bananas. I headed back to work (total time spent commuting today: 4 hours). Even though it was only my second real day on the job, I think I'm getting used to things pretty quickly. My use of words may not be sufficiently polite at times, and I'm sure I'm still making mistakes, but I took quite a few orders, and served plenty more people than before. I also learned (not really an appropriate word, but it'll have to do) how to change the grille on the brazier used to cook the mean, and how to clean up tables after customers have left. I got asked a few questions by some salarymen, and ended up talking to two guys for 5 minutes or so after I'd delivered them their tea. If things keep going this way, I might actually have a chance to use more Japanese than I thought I would, but the scope of conversation is rather limited. Nonetheless, I was pleased that someone went out of their way to talk to me. I also learned that I can't guess people's age, unless it's really obvious. I thought my 17 year old co-worker was a university student, which she seemed pleased about. Thinking about it now, aren't people of the female persuasion supposed to be annoyed when you guess their age above what it actually is? Perhaps it's different for high school students.

My shift finished, and I was rather tired after standing for 4 hours straight. Given my usual sedentary lifestyle sitting in front of a computer screen in a not-particularly-comfortable chair for 12+ hours a day, this is not really surprising. I got home, and decided to check my emails, and there was one from Keio. For a moment I disregarded it as some more information about something I wasn't particularly interested in, but I read it anyway. I was rather surprised to find that I had been selected as a recipient of the additional allocation JASSO scholarship, whatever that may mean. Whatever it means, the key point is that I have been allocated this scholarship for three months. The JASSO scholarship was something that we could apply for during the application period for the study abroad year, and of course I went for it, because why the hell not. It's a scholarship from the Japanese government (who seem to really like handing out money to foreign people, even though they seem to dislike them rather a lot [see: JET]), which gives a monthly stipend of ￥80,000. Some students get this for the whole study abroad period, but I don't think that anyone from Birmingham has received it. I'm rather pleased to get this, since the current state of the pound/yen is massively in the favour of the yen at the moment (i.e. the pound is terrible), and it will mean that at least I can feel a little bit more free about spending some money. Also, a scholarship is a nice thing to put on my CV, even though I can't even remember why it's awarded (I seem to remember it being randomly chosen, but that is surely incorrect).

Maybe today wasn't a good day after all. I'm inexperienced in experiencing good days, so I can't tell.

Oh well.


  
  <h2><a href="/2011/12/some-imaginative-title.html">Some imaginative title</a></h2>
  11 Dec 2011
  Even though it hasn't been so long since I last wrote something, I thought I might as well - in part due to not really feeling like doing any work.

I had my first proper shift at my part time job on Friday, which was interesting, for lack of a better word. Most food establishments here use handheld devices to take orders from customers, so I was tested a little on my ability to use that. Given that I'm used to using user interfaces which aren't particularly fantastic, that side of things isn't much of a problem. It's a pretty simple touch screen interface which is divided into various sections for alcoholic drinks, non-alcoholic drinks, Japanese meat, pork, so on and so forth. The main problem with it is that you have to be able to use it fast, and since I've had no practice at all, it often takes me quite a while to find what's been ordered. Not being able to read Japanese quickly also factors into this.

As you may know, Japanese service etiquette is very polite. While this may be nice from the customer's point of view, from the employee's perspective, this is quite a significant problem, in particular in my case. An often used phrase to describe this is "マヌアル通り", which can be roughly translated as "by the book". Companies often have manuals which employees are often required to follow when speaking to customers. Of course, how strongly enforced this policy is depends on the establishment. If you're at an upper class restaurant, then the likelihood is that things will be repeated word for word for maximum politeness and minimum possibility of offending the customer. Where I'm working, we're able to change stuff around, as long as the general feeling (and of course the meaning) of what is written comes across. I've been spending a lot of time outside of work hours memorising parts of this manual, because that's what you're expected to do. One would think that once you leave work, it isn't a problem to forget about it until your next shift. However, in Japan, that's not the case. The example I've described above is not by any means the only example. Although it's not really on the same level, salarymen are often required to go drinking after work, for some sort of team bonding - this often means that your general work day ends up being from 7 (so you can get on the train to get to work on time) to 10 or later. Sounds like fun.

At any rate, my shift started with me attempting to familiarise myself with the usage of the so-called "handy" by looking through the various menus and trying to find stuff as quickly as possible. After some time doing that, I was tested on my ability to repeat the words in the manual in the correct order, which wasn't bad, but "needs more practice". Gradually, the shop started to fill up, so I was tasked with delivering stuff to tables. Luckily, there's no need to remember the names of the dishes - when an order is done, it's placed on a counter with a little card saying what it is, and which table it needs to go to. Unfortunately, some of the dishes are to be eaten in a specific way, so sometimes it's necessary to explain that, rather than just saying what it is and excusing yourself. After doing that for a while, I was introduced to the method of taking breaks. First you have to check out on your time card (no getting paid while on break), and then you can grab some food. Was pretty tasty. One of the chefs had prepared some beef stir fry type thing, and I had rice with kimchi on it, on top of that. Spent half an hour talking to one of the guys who has been working there for a while about various things. Back on the shift, I carried on serving for a little bit. By this time, the place was completely full, so everyone was pretty busy. Dirty dishes were stacking up, so I was shown how to work the dishwasher. Now, having been in charge of emptying the dishwasher at home for many years, I'm pretty confident in my abilities in this area. However, I was rather taken aback by the speed at which the restaurant manager loaded and unloaded the trays used for putting dishes on. It seems obvious now that the restaurant would have an industrial-type dishwasher, but I was sort of expecting stuff to be done manually. Once a tray is loaded, you shove it into the dishwasher and close the lid, as it were. It looks like a sort of press, but details are unimportant. Once the lid is down, you have 90 seconds in which to unload the washed dishes and load up the tray with dirty stuff. After about an hour and a half, I had things going pretty well. I was kind of expecting to be bored of doing essentially the same thing over and over, but actually it wasn't too bad. Compared to one of my previous jobs where I often had nothing to do for a few hours a day, actually having something to do is a blessing. At least I can challenge myself to see how fast I can get things done, and work out the most efficient methods of loading and unloading in order to save time. It's pretty difficult to challenge oneself when there's nothing to do.


  
  <h2><a href="/2011/11/third-time-lucky.html">Third time lucky</a></h2>
  29 Nov 2011
  I have managed to secure a part time job, it seems.

After being rejected from Uniqlo and Book Off, probably due to my lack of any proper Japanese qualifications, I decided to apply to Gyuukaku, a yakiniku (lit: cooked meat) place after looking around on the web for "Foreigners OK" jobs. The Japanese have little subtlety when it comes to xenophobia. It's a pretty big chain - over 1000 restaurants in Japan, and branches in the US, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia.

At any rate, I went to the shop after lessons had finished on Friday, and talked to the manager after lessons had finished for the day, and gave him some of my details, after which I was asked to come back on Monday for a proper interview (I didn't have my Japanese personal statement equivalent with me at the time). Returning on Monday, I was asked to fill in a sort of interview questionnaire which had questions like "Give a good and bad point of your personality" and "What do you think it is necessary to do to satisfy customers". In Japanese, of course. I had no real problems thinking up answers, but writing them down in some sort of coherent way took a little bit of thought. After I'd finished filling that in, the manager asked me a few questions, which I now can't remember, but I got the feeling that things went relatively well, since he asked me some stuff which wasn't really relevant to the job at all. I guess he might have been testing my Japanese ability.

I left relatively satisfied, but still not convinced that I'd actually managed to make a decent impression. He would call me on Tuesday afternoon with the results.

Something must have gone right, since I got the call, and was told that they would like to employ me. Now all I have to do is buy some black shoes.

Maybe the third time really is lucky! (I'd like to see some data, though)


  
  <h2><a href="/2011/11/hunting.html">Hunting</a></h2>
  03 Nov 2011
  With the economy being as it is, I have decided that the amount of money graciously provided by the British taxpayer will not be sufficient if I am to make full use of the time that I have here in Japan. As such, I've decided to look for part time jobs so that I have some money to actually go and see some places which aren't just urban sprawls (and of course buy nice things).

Begin braindump.

The average university student in Japan is a very interesting creature. From what I have been able to observe from a relatively small sample size, there are large differences between UK and Japanese students. For me, the thing that stands out most is perhaps the effort that a lot of students go through to go to university. In the UK, the furthest you'd reasonably expect someone to live from the university is around 30 minutes, and even that is pushing it (I can talk, having lived about 30 minutes on foot from the university last year...). At any rate, it seems like students are on the same level as commuters, at least in the big cities. Since most universities in places like Tokyo and Osaka are very limited in terms of space, most students are unable to live close to universities due to high rent, and perhaps other reasons. Taking this into account, it is not particularly surprising that a lot of students commute an hour or so each way to get to university. I also believe that the percentage of students who live with their parents is also quite different to that of the UK, but I don't have any hard evidence. Another thing that rather surprised me is the time until which students stay on campus. One of the Japanese students at the dormitory that I am staying in had a seminar that finished at around 9:30pm. This might be an exceptional case for a specific subject, similar to medicine in the UK, I suppose. There seem to be large disparities in the lecturing hours of students, but again I suppose that this is a case of courses being different. It seems that here the main struggle is to actually get into a good university - once you're in, it's pretty easy to leave with some form of qualification that will actually be useful. If you manage to get into a university with a good reputation, then your chances of getting a decent job also increase. So, in the end, it seems as thought it's your own choice whether you actually work hard or not. Well, it's the same in the UK to some extent, but at least if you want to have any chance of passing you have to actually do some work. Over here, a rather large percentage of the marks for a course are assigned purely on whether you turn up for lectures - a lot of students show up and promptly go to sleep. With this abundance of spare time, a significant number of students have part time jobs with which they support whatever lifestyle they decide to lead (inevitably drinking rather a lot, and probably going to karaoke.)

I congratulate you if you got anything out of the above paragraph. Anyway, given that the part-time job seems to be an important part of university life, I decided to try my hand at getting one. My first attempt was a second-hand book shop, Book Off, which is really awesome. Perhaps it warrants its own post at some point, although the likelihood of me getting round to that is small. At any rate, I applied through their online system, only to be told that they do not accept foreigners who don't have JLPT N1 under their belt (significantly more politely than that though). Rather a blow, but whatever, it's their company. Next, I tried out for Uniqlo, another shop that I know relatively well. I called them up and asked whether they hire foreigners, and it seemed as though no real qualifications were necessary, as long as you can speak Japanese. I arranged an interview for the next Thursday, and had a hunt for potential interview questions on the web. I vaguely prepared some bullet points on questions that I thought were likely to come up. I got one of the questions right, but if they didn't ask that one (why do you want to work here?) then it'd have been rather odd. I was asked about teamwork experience, and how I helped the team work together and reach a final goal. Took me rather by surprise, and I floundered around trying to explain about my experience with the Robot Club at Birmingham, which didn't go very well (the explanation, not the club). After that, another unexpected question came up - how do you go about making sure that customers leave the shop satisfied. Again, I managed to blab some stuff about them finding what they were looking for, and being served by polite staff, but it was a complete mess, even from my perspective, so I can't imagine how stupid the interviewer thought I was. It was pretty impossible to tell what the interviewer was thinking, but I realised pretty quickly after the interview ended that I'd be incredibly lucky to get the job after that performance.

On Monday, I was in Book Off, buying more books (apparently used, but for all intents and purposes, pretty much new) for 85p. I'd noticed before that they still had signs up stating that they were recruiting part-timers, so I decided to ask the person at the till if they would take on foreigners (again). I got the same answer as before, and got an interview set for Thursday. I decided that I'd prepare a little better this time, and actually wrote out what I was planning to say for each of my predicted questions. I ended up with around a page, and read it to myself out loud a few times to get it into my head a little. When taking down the interview time, I forgot to check the actual date, so I wasn't sure whether it was this Thursday or next Thursday, but I had some sort of vague faith in my Japanese ability so I went in today. I'm not sure if I was right or not, but I guess I was, because after hanging around for 10 minutes or so (timing is very precise. I arrived at the Uniqlo interview 3 minutes or so before the specified time, and was told to come back when it was time), the interviewer arrived and took me to a very tiny room with some people on computers in it. I handed over my rirekisho, which is similar to a CV, but is standard for everyone. You get very little room to write anything about yourself, and the only other section is school and work history. Anyway, this time things went a lot better, at least from my point of view. I answered the "why do you want to work here" question much better this time, and was also asked about which manga I liked, since I said that I visit the shop pretty much every week to buy manga. I was then asked whether I had taken JLPT, and since I haven't taken it yet, replied with that. After that I was asked if I had any questions, so I vaguely asked where they get most of their stock from, and what sort of regulations there are on work clothing, and then the interview was over. My phone number was taken down, and then I got my rirekisho back, which seemed odd, since Uniqlo kept the one that I brought to that interview. Perhaps this is an obvious pointer that I didn't pass. I didn't quite catch what was said when I was given it back. From the abruptness of the transfer from the JLPT question and questions from me, I can only assume that I've failed a second time, but I was told that I'd know by tomorrow whether I had the job, via standard procedure - a call if I get it, nothing at all if I don't.

Even though I'd like to have some money to spend, I might just give up now, since it seems difficult to get a job as a foreigner in a place where a reasonable portion is interaction with customers. Why hire someone whose Japanese is mediocre at best, when even the stupidest Japanese person has a higher skill level than me. My level is probably equivalent to children just leaving primary school, which is slightly depressing, but oh well. Also, having to work is obviously a drain on time that I need for study, although in all honesty I probably have too much spare time, and am just wasting it mindlessly browsing the same sites as usual. Then again, with no money, I can't do anything in my spare time, since going anywhere costs money. If I want to leave Tokyo at some point then it's going to cost me a reasonable amount of money. Dilemmas, dilemmas. I could always dig into my savings, but at the moment I don't really feel as if it's really worth it.

  <h2><a href="/2011/10/education-matters.html">Education Matters</a></h2>
  29 Oct 2011
  So, It's been rather a while since I started at Keio, so I thought that I may as well write some stuff about what I've actually been studying.

I've been assigned to level 7 of 12 in Keio's Japanese language programme, which puts me at the end of intermediate level study. I'm pretty pleased about this, given that back in Birmingham we were only taught up to somewhere at the beginning of the intermediate level. It's certainly noticeable - most of the people in my class have been studying Japanese as their major, so they've got the advantage of actually having studied things properly rather than blundering through it like our class did. My range of vocabulary is lacking massively, and within the first week I'd written down something like 200 new kanji that I'd never studied before (although probably read in manga and heard said in anime). The rate of addition to my kanji lists has slowed down a little, but according to our teachers the textbook we're using is very heavy on kanji that aren't often used at the level that we're studying at, so there are still plenty of new kanji every week, which is nice. Also learning plenty of new grammars which seem useful, but far too hard to use in conversation without a lot of practice.

We have two teachers - Watanabe-sensei and Ikeda-sensei. Watanabe-sensei is perhaps one of the younger teachers in the department (early 30s?), and at first I thought she'd be one of those scary "I've just come out of grad school, so I'm going to do things properly" kind of teacher, but the classes are generally pretty entertaining and we often waste a lot of time by discussing things that come out of someone's example sentence for a grammar. Ikeda-sensei's classes are pretty light-hearted, and she seems a little more lenient than Watanabe-sensei, and we end up spending a little more time than usual on various things due to going off on tangents a little, but I still think that I learn a reasonable amount from the class.

Alongside the base classes (which run for 9 hours a week), I'm taking 5 other classes to attempt to improve my overall Japanese level.

Pronunciation is a moderately interesting class in which we're learning the correct intonation for words, and the correct way to pronounce various bits of the language that people often have trouble with, such as っ, ん, long sounds and dotted mora (e.g. が,か - people whose mother tongue is Chinese often mix these). I'd say that pronunciation is the strongest part of my Japanese, since I learned almost entirely by listening to it being spoken, but I took the class mainly to see if there were any weird habits that I'd picked up. So far it seems like I haven't. Also got a pronunciation dictionary which isn't really that useful, but it will look nice on a shelf.

The presentation class is possibly my least favourite class, since I'm terrible at presenting things. Nothing serious - in the past two weeks, we've spoken about 'trouble' we had, and out personality. Everyone else in the class seems to be writing out what they want to say in advance and sort of learning it, whereas I, because I'm lazy, just write out a few bullet points and relevant vocabulary and then try and string sentences together on the spot. After all, isn't that how speaking works? Unless you have a speech, then you're unlikely to have what you're saying written out, and even if you do have stuff written down, if the topic suddenly changes, then you're left with no choice but to think things up on the spot. Not to mention that most of the time you'll be speaking in any language is when conversing with people, in which case you'd have to be an idiot to try and make a script. At the moment I'm struggling to put together coherent sentences, with good flow, but hopefully this will get better eventually.

Writing class is pretty self explanatory - we write stuff about a predefined topic. We're given a topic each week, and the next week we have ~40 minutes in which to write a ~400 character piece. It was pretty difficult the first time, but the last two pieces I've written I think have been improving slowly. We barely wrote any thing other than sentence-long answers in Birmingham, apart from the occasional half-page, so I think this class will allow me to improve quite a lot.

Grammar is also obvious. We have a book. The teacher reads from the book and occasionally makes some point on the grammar that we're doing. Not a very interesting class, but at least I'm getting exposed to some grammars. We seem to do some work on forms, or whatever you call them. Passive, causative and suchlike.

Finally, the modern text reading class, which I am alone in. During the auditing period the teacher wasn't around/there was a typhoon when the class was supposed to take place, so nobody went to see it. Seems like I was the only one stupid enough to put down a class without going to see it first. Anyway, it's pretty good - essentially private tuition, so the level of the texts can be matched to my level a lot better. The first few texts we read were really easy, but this week I was given a two-page short novel to read, which was a lot more interesting and challenging to read. I have to read aloud a lot, which is one of my weak points, so I'm pretty pleased that there's nobody else to steal my reading-aloud-time. I hope to see a large improvement in my ability to read texts out loud by the end of this semester.

With regards to the actual teaching style, there is quite a disparity between the Japanese style and the style that I'm used to back in the UK. I don't think either system is particularly good, but in my eyes the Japanese system is quite a lot worse. I don't really remember how things worked in the UK, since I've put the study I did before university into some deep recess of my brain, but I think it was based on forming your own opinion of things in literature subjects, and learning a base fact in the sciences, and then expanding from that to see what it led to. The latter may just be my hope of how things were - I doubt it was actually like that. Probably just memorisation of various things without really understanding them. Which is how the Japanese system works. We had a test two weeks ago, and were told to memorise a conversation. In the test, we had to fill in some parts that were left out of the original. Now, this didn't really bother me since the contents of the conversation were actually relevant in certain situations, and many of the phrases in it probably come up relatively often (it was asking someone politely to make an appointment). However, the teacher made the point that the Japanese educational system is based almost entirely on rote memorisation. This is a country where there are small sections of stationery shops containing various types of flashcards, and I've seen them a few times in the convenience stores that are dotted every few hundred metres. The level 8 and 9 classes apparently are required to memorise long texts. One of the people who I meet in the kitchen quite often is in the level 9 class, and their text book is made up of ~4 page long texts of extracts from lectures on the development of literature in Japan, and the geography of Tokyo, or something like that. From what I heard, in their tests the teacher plays part of a sentence from the text, and then the students have to finish the sentence. Which is absurd. I see no point whatsoever for this. Even in our class, we write out sentences to practice grammar points that we've learned in class, the teacher corrects them, and then the recommended thing to do with this corrected sentence is to memorise it. In the test, we're allowed ... no, encouraged, to write down the same sentence that we wrote before, since if we try and make a new sentence and get a bit of it wrong then we'll lose marks.

My main qualm with memorisation is that it limits your knowledge to a very small area. Take the grammar memorisation example above. Memorising a single sentence is not the optimum way to remember a grammar by any means. A single sentence cannot possibly encompass all of the ways that that grammar can be used. If you are going to remember a grammar, then if you really have to memorise it, then perhaps it would be best to learn where the verb goes, where you put the adjective, the relation between the first and second part of the grammar if it is of that structure. Even then, you still don't really know the grammar, although you're probably more able to put it into use than someone who has simply remembered a single sentence. The ideal way, obviously, is to be exposed to the grammar as much as possible. The main problem with this is, of course, that you have to have a significant time span in which this exposure is able to happen. The grammar and words of almost everyone's first language will have been learned like this, and those people can use the grammar without even having to think about where the subject and verb goes - hell, I don't even know where verbs and all of that stuff goes in an English sentence without dismantling it. I barely even knew what an adverb was until a few years ago. If I can use it perfectly, I don't need to know what it's called, right? Here's a quote from my favourite person ever, theoretical physicist Richard P. Feynman:
<blockquote><strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05WS0WN7zMQ" target="_blank">I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.</a></strong></blockquote>
Maybe this has no real relation to the point I'm trying to make, but I know that I can't be bothered with memorisation, since it's not really learning something. Yes, I am bad at explaining things, and bad at making points.

Our teacher assured us that these memorisation methods work, but I for one don't really want to be messing about memorising a four page text. The other students in my class were similarly shocked, given that most of my class comes from countries which don't use memorisation that much. Next semester, I will aim to get to level 10 so that I can avoid these memorisation games, otherwise I'm pretty sure that I'll be annoyed for the whole semester

Hey, I wrote an essay.

  Today I went to Shinjuku to go up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Metropolitan_Government_Building">Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building</a>. I don't know what I was expecting really, it was pretty much exactly like all other photos of Tokyo from skyscrapers. I had a go at taking a few interesting photographs, but I don't think it went very well. Not to worry, I spent about 500 yen the whole day, so at least it was cheap. I walked to Yoyogi from Shinjuku, and passed through Meiji shrine on the way. I guess it could be called impressive, but it didn't really strike me as that fantastic. Probably didn't help that they were building the stage for some event. Yoyogi park was insanely packed. The Harajuku gate had loads of 30-40 year old people doing various forms of dancing to rock songs which I'd never heard before, and inside the park there were loads of people out with families/friends/people of some relation doing various things. Badminton, digeridoos, drums, band practices and juggling were a few of the activities that I noticed. Today's pictures can be found <a title="here" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/archives/date-posted/2011/10/09/" target="_blank">here</a>. Or <a title="here" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/" target="_blank">here</a> for everything.

Been pretty busy, and therefore had little time to update. I've had the weekend off, Monday is a national holiday and Tuesday I have no lectures, so I might write something (very) long in the near future.

  I went to Shinjuku today intending to buy a tripod so that I can take some night shots. Ended up looking in two massive electronics shops. One of them (Yodobashi camera) is so huge that it has various buildings for different types of electronics. There was a five floor building entirely centered on camera stuff, but I ended up not finding a tripod that I wanted. As often happens, I ended up walking around for a bit, and took a few photographs. Nothing particularly interesting, but oh well. After wandering a little I stumbled upon a Uniqlo, and had a look just in case they had offers on some things. Luckily, they had slippers for 790 yen odd, which was nice. Not sure if I really need them that much, but a lot of people in Japan use slippers when walking around in their house, since outdoor shoes are left in the genkan (entrance). After that, I went back to Shibuya to take the train back to Hiyoshi, and noticed that there was a part of the platform on the other side that had quite a good view of the Shinjuku crossing without a window or anything in the way, although I had to lean over a "no entry" gate to get pictures without a fence in the way. Ended up getting only one presentable shot, but I think I'll go back there when the crossing is at its most chaotic, at night, and get a slightly more atmospheric, and hopefully better, shot.
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/6155249356"><img class="aligncenter" title="shiiibuyaaa" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6155249356_fed7e96704_b.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="717" /></a><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/6154640823">
</a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The past week was exciting, in a very loose sense of the word. We had a placement test to split us into groups based on Japanese ability level. Some parts of the test were pretty tough, but I was expecting it to be like that since they have twelve levels to split students into, and the top levels are for people with pretty much native level Japanese. What they're doing taking a Japanese course, I have no idea. At any rate, I ended up in level 7, which is quite a lot higher than I expected.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">I was told that I scored the worst in the writing test of everyone in my level, but I'm not really surprised. Most of the later questions I pretty much guessed, since I didn't have any clue what the grammar structure was. For example, "~ざるを得ない" seems to be an archaic grammar structure which expresses something which must be done. I must have made up for my low mark in the writing in the other tests though, since I ended up in this level. Most people who are on this course seem to be taking Japanese as the main part of their course, so I feel as if things are a little unfair, but I guess it's about time I got a feeling of what it's like to be at the bottom of the class. We're apparently having another test next week to make sure that we are in the right class, so I think I'm going to have to study a little bit to make sure I can stay here. I don't really feel like moving down, since at this level I'm very close to the advanced level, which means that I'll have to move up to the pre-advanced classes next semester, since we're not allowed to do the core modules at the same level that we did before. If I move down to level 6 then I might end up only getting to level 7 by the next semester, which would be rather disappointing. I plan to try and reverse any decision to move me down a level based on the fact that I prefer working on things that are too difficult than things which are too easy. Don't know how well that will go down, though.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">The homework we were given in the introduction session, although not particularly interesting, is far better than the ones that I've become used to from Birmingham's Japanese department. There are kanji I don't know, which is fun, and I actually have to think about what to write down rather than it coming to me straight away. If it continues this way then this year will definitely be fruitful.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">We're able to make various choices on modules for this semester. We have six core  modules (基本科目), and then we can choose one or more modules from subjects with a specific focus  (技能別科目),  Japanese cultural modules (日本文化科目). There are also modules from other disciplines such as economics and linguistics and so forth which we can choose from, which are taught in English. When I was at the short interview with the supervisors, they were rather surprised that I already had a list of the modules that I was interested in taking written down. Seems normal to me, but I guess not everyone is as obsessed about planning as I am. I've tentatively decided to study intermediate orthography (kanji), intermediate grammar, intermediate conversation, intermediate or advanced aural comprehension and intermediate modern text reading.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Orthography teaches another 250 kanji to people who already know around 500, which is pretty the number that I've studied properly. I can recognise and read probably around 150-200 more from reading manga and watching Japanese TV, but that might be an over-exaggeration. I was advised against taking this, since we will apparently learn a lot of kanji in the core classes. We were also told that we should know around 1100 kanji at this level, but I think that's a bit over the top, since four of thirteen people in my class knew around 700.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Grammar contains work on structures from level N2 of the JLPT, so I thought that'd be useful to take. I was recommended to go and have a look at the lower level class as well (most classes have several levels. For example grammar has levels I, II and III, of increasing difficulty. I've opted to take the most difficult class in each level, because why not?), since it might match my level better. If it turns out that the level is too high, then I might drop down to level II, but that means that I'll have to decide whether to take this class or the conversation class, since they clash. Apparently grammar is studied quite a lot in the core classes as well, so it might not be necessary to take this class, but we'll see.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/6154640823"><img class="aligncenter" title="forbidden" src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6074/6154640823_7c5db45369_b.jpg" alt="" width="478" height="717" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Conversation is pretty self explanatory, just thought about taking it in case it would actually have some use. Whether I take it or not depends on the content of the class. It could be useful, but I can pretty much get by with normal conversation.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Aural comprehension is again self explanatory. Listening is my strongest point, so maybe I should concentrate on taking classes in something that I'm not very good at (writing), but I feel like I might as well take advantage of being reasonably good at listening so that I can improve even more.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Modern text reading is about reading modern novels and stuff, I suppose. I'm not really sure how useful this will be, since I don't really like reading novels - just science literature all the time. There's no class for that, so this is probably the best thing to do. It teaches stuff on grammar understanding and the like, so I guess it's a good way to cement knowledge. There's another course in newspaper reading, but if Japanese newspapers are anything at all like British newspapers, then I couldn't care less about the content. Then again, I do watch anime and TV shows with pretty much no substance whatsoever from time to time just to practice Japanese ...</p>
We're able to have  a look at classes without signing up for them throughout next week, so I'm going to go and have a look at all the classes that I've written down and then decide from there.

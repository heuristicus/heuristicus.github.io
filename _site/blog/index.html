    <h2><a href="/2013/06/welcome.html">Welcome</a></h2>
    Jun 09, 2013

    <section class="postcontent">
    <p>Welcome to my new website. I kept telling myself that I needed to make myself a
one, but never managed to get round to it. Until now. Having finished exams I
decided that either I&rsquo;d do it now, or it would have to wait another two years at
least.</p>

<p>With that, let&rsquo;s go into some more detail on exactly what I&rsquo;ve done. The site is
generated using a very nice static site generator,
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, which was recommended to me quite a while ago by
<a href="http://jeremiahvia.com">Jeremiah Via</a>. Jekyll transforms plain text files
(mostly HTML and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>) into
a mess of HTML which hopefully looks just as you wanted it to. Working with HTML
and CSS hasn&rsquo;t been particularly fun. Having not used either since secondary
school, it&rsquo;s taken me a while to work out how to control the things that I want
to control. Some things are still confusing, but hopefully once I get things
right once the next time I need to do something similar I&rsquo;ll know basically what
to do. I set up the basic parts required for Jekyll by following
<a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/other/building-static-sites-with-jekyll/">this tutorial</a>
and some of the information on the official page, and after that it was mostly
tweaking the CSS.</p>

<p>Since you&rsquo;re reading this, you can see another thing that Jekyll does&mdash;it
creates pages for blog posts from either markdown or HTML files. Being one of
those people who uses <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> for
everything, this is a Good Thing. I can write posts directly into Emacs without
having to access some web interface, which means that I can use all the packages
I&rsquo;ve collected in the past three years. Jekyll uses the
<a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> library, which frees you from having to write
HTML for every post on the site. Just work out the structure you want to have
each post follow, throw it into a for loop over all the posts on your
site, and you&rsquo;re done. Here&rsquo;s the code which generates the <a href="/blog">blog</a>.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html">    <span class="nt">&lt;section</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;content&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">&quot;posts&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    
        {% for post in site.posts offset: 0 limit: 5 %}
        <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;fullpost&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
          <span class="nt">&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a</span> <span class="na">href=</span><span class="s">&quot;{{ post.url }}&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>{{ post.title }}<span class="nt">&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
          {{ post.date | date: &quot;%b %d, %Y&quot; }}
    
          <span class="nt">&lt;section</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;postcontent&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
            {{ post.content }}
          <span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
          
          <span class="nt">&lt;section</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;posttags&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
            Filed under {{ post.tags | array_to_sentence_string }}.
          <span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;breaker&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
        {% endfor %}
      <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
   <span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Ignoring my terrible HTML, it&rsquo;s rather neat.</p>

<p>You may have noticed the pretty code highlighting in the snippet above. This is
done with the <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> syntax highlighter, which Jekyll
can be set up to run whenever the site is built. It converts code in special
Liquid tags into a mass of HTML elements, which are then coloured with CSS
generated from one of the themes which comes with Pygments. Being unimaginative
as usual, I&rsquo;m using the
<a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a> font (which
you may or may not be able to see, depending on your browser), which
I&rsquo;ve been using in Emacs and IDEs since I discovered it a couple of years
ago. I&rsquo;ve looked around for other programming fonts, but haven&rsquo;t yet found any
which are better&mdash;if you know a good one, let me know! You might find some
other good-looking fonts for coding
<a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.slant.co/topics/67/~what-are-the-best-programming-fonts">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also couldn&rsquo;t help but add something which can display proper mathematical
equations. Leaving aside whether I&rsquo;ll actually use the feature, it&rsquo;s definitely
something which I could not be without. The site uses the
<a href="http://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> display engine to render equations. You can
right click to retrieve the <code>$\LaTeX$</code> code, zoom, and do various other useful
things. Try it out on the equations below.</p>

<p><em>Bayes' Theorem</em>
<code>\[P(A\mid B)=\frac{P(B\mid A)P(A)}{P(B)}\]</code></p>

<p><em>Q-learning</em>
<code>\[Q_{t+1}(s_t,a_t)=Q_t(s_t,a_t)+\alpha(s_t,a_t)\cdot\left[R_{t_1}+\gamma\max_aQ_t(s_{t+1},a)-Q_t(s_t,a_t)\right]\]</code></p>

<p><em>Jacobian matrix</em>
<code>\begin{align}
    J=\begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial{F_1}}{\partial{x_1}}&amp;\dots &amp;\frac{\partial{F_1}}{\partial{x_n}}\\
    \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
    \frac{\partial{F_m}}{\partial{x_1}}&amp;\dots &amp;\frac{\partial{F_m}}{\partial{x_n}}\\
    \end{bmatrix}
 \end{align}</code></p>

<p>It took a little while to get this stuff all rendering correctly. Javascript is
required, and by default doesn&rsquo;t work with markdown because when the files are
parsed markdown converts some characters to HTML, which means that MathJax no
longer picks up the equations correctly. I managed to get things working thanks
to these
<a href="http://checkmyworking.com/2012/01/how-to-get-beautifully-typeset-maths-on-your-blog/">two</a>
<a href="http://doswa.com/2011/07/20/mathjax-in-markdown.html">posts</a>. Having sorted
that, I was getting orange text instead of the black I expected. Turns out
MathJax uses the same CSS styles as some of those in the Pygments CSS file used
to do code highlighting. Thankfully, the first google
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/mathjax-users/FgCBLdT15nM">result</a>
solved the problem by just adding some more CSS to override the definitions.</p>

<p>The design for the site, simple as it is, was inspired by
<a href="http://rsms.me/">Rasmus Andersson</a>&rsquo;s homepage, which is one of the pages
featured on the Jekyll site. The
<a href="https://github.com/rsms/rsms.github.com">Github repository</a> for his page has
all of the CSS and HTML he uses, so after poring over that for a couple of days
I finally managed to work out how things pieced together and implement something
vaguely similar. I&rsquo;m using the fantastic
<a href="http://www.linuxlibertine.org/">Linux Libertine</a> fonts as the standard font,
which I use for almost everything now (including
<a href="/projects/gravlens/">my dissertation</a>). The site should look reasonably good no
matter what device it&rsquo;s viewed on, because I&rsquo;m arranging everything based on
proportions of the height and width. The font also changes size depending on the
width of the window you&rsquo;re viewing the site in (the site updates automatically
if you&rsquo;re in Firefox or IE, but you&rsquo;ll need to refresh to see the effect in
Chrome), which should make things much less ugly even when you&rsquo;re looking at it
in a tiny window (stop it). If something on the site doesn&rsquo;t work or looks
weird, then I&rsquo;d appreciate if you could let me know so I can try and fix it.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2012/02/its-been-a-while.html">It's been a while...</a></h2>
    Feb 24, 2012

    <section class="postcontent">
    <p>&hellip;and nothing much has happened. What follows is a report that I wrote in order to fulfil a requirement of my scholarship. It&rsquo;s pretty rough, as I didn&rsquo;t bother reading through after I&rsquo;d written it. Since the limit was a page, I couldn&rsquo;t really go into depth on anything, but since I wrote it I thought I may as well put it up here as I haven&rsquo;t written anything for a while.</p>

<p>In this short report, I intend to detail a few of my experiences in Japan, and also to discuss my what I think of the country after spending more or less half a year studying at Keio University. With another 4 months left here it is possible that I will discover that my opinions on some things that I discuss here change. However, I write this with reasonable confidence that the assumptions I make are not entirely unfounded.</p>

<p>I had been told that the Japanese summer is hot, but was not particularly concerned, since heat can be easily tolerated by sitting in the shade somewhere. Or so I thought. The first thing that surprised me a little as I arrived in Japan at the beginnning of September was the humidity. There was nowhere I could hide from its ever-present sweat-inducing heat. Given that I had arrived only a few months after the Touhoku earthquake, a lot of Tokyo was in power-saving mode, and so even if there was air conditioning, it was not being used. While enduring the humidity, I travelled into the centre of Tokyo, taking a train through rural Chiba prefecture. The difference between the start and end point of the journey was quite striking&mdash; mostly open fields in Chiba, gradually transforming into the high-rise concrete jungle of Tokyo. I have grown used to advertisements, having lived in London for most of my life, but the scale in Tokyo was on a completely different level. It seemed as thought almost any space that could be seen from the train had some billboard advertising some product or other, or if not, the name of the company which owned the building.</p>

<p>Having been conditioned to Japan through anime, friends and my occasional viewing of Japanese TV programmes, as well as looking at a lot of photographs, I was not overwhelmed by anything in particular, and have not at this point experienced anything which I feel can be said to be culture shock. If anything, I have grown to like Tokyo, with its extensive train network and the ease of access to any product that you may be looking for. I would have liked to take advantage of this, but at the time of writing, economic climate means that the yen is almost prohibitively expensive. Not one to give up, I quickly discovered that Japanese second-hand shops are fantastic places to find things. In the UK there are many second hand shops, but the quality of the products is often far below that of anything that you could buy new. In contrast, the vast majority of used products in Japan seem to be in extremely good shape. A second hand bicycle I bought was to me indistinguishable from a new one. Second hand books and manga are in the majority of cases in very good condition (and very cheap, to boot). The are also many second hand clothes shops, and given the Japanese interest obsession with fashion, you will not be hard pressed to find a set of stylish clothing for a relatively small price.</p>

<p>The most obvious difference that I have seen so far is the method of teaching that seems to be very common here. In the UK, and from what I have heard, the US as well, students are taught to think for themselves and come up with their own explanations of whatever they are being taught, if it is possible to do so. In my experience, this generally works well, although of course it depends a lot on both the student and the teacher. I accept that there are many problems with the education system of the UK, but the teaching methods in Japan are, to me, rather odd. It seems as though the basis for most learning is memorisation. This is not surprising, since the Japanese writing system essentially requires the memorisation of two thousand or so characters. However, for me, this does not mean that rote memorisation should be used to learn other things as well. I was lucky enough to not have had to do much of it because of the class that I was put into, but friends have told me that much of their lessons and homework consisted of rote memorisation of long passages of text. We discussed this in our class for a while, and were assured that the students in classes using mostly memorisation progress just as much as those who focus on other methods, but I am somewhat doubtful of the validity of this statement, at least for myself personally. I find that once the exam or whatever other thing I have memorised something for is over, I forget everything extremely quickly. In my opinion, understanding of something is gained at a relatively slow pace, purely through exposure to the same general concept in many different contexts. This is probably why native speakers are so good at speaking their language&mdash;they have had a lot of time to learn the nuances of words, phrases and so on, and when they can be used.</p>

<p>This year so far has been a very interesting one. Meeting people whose interests and field of study are completely different from mine, being immersed in a foreign culture, studying a language full-time, finding a part-time job in a country whose language I have yet to master, and having the opportunity to think about questions that I would probably not have considered of much importance if I had been asked only a few months ago.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2011/12/a-good-day.html">A Good Day</a></h2>
    Dec 13, 2011

    <section class="postcontent">
    <p>Today, I have had a Good Day. Yes, with capital letters.</p>

<p>Started off with the usual lessons, where we did nothing particularly interesting, but it was enjoyable as usual. After that, I had a 5 hour break before I had my second shift at work. I spent a while contemplating what to do, and eventually decided to go to Shibuya, which is where I always go when I want to go somewhere and can&rsquo;t really think of anywhere. Hung around the Book Off, hunting for books in the 105 section, but didn&rsquo;t find anything new. Had a look around the used clothes shop on the bottom floor (which is quite good, although not actually that much cheaper than buying retail. Uniqlo and that other shop&hellip;H&amp;M are probably cheaper.) decided I didn&rsquo;t have enough money to spend on anything new, and couldn&rsquo;t really be bothered to look through tons of stuff to find something nice.</p>

<p>I decided to head home and have a nap, but ended up attempting to cook some meat with some peppers and various Japanese condiments, but it came out very average. I also discovered that the bottom shelf of my fridge is a freezer, and not split into a freezer and fridge. This resulted in the peppers being interesting to cut, and some rather brown bananas. I headed back to work (total time spent commuting today: 4 hours). Even though it was only my second real day on the job, I think I&rsquo;m getting used to things pretty quickly. My use of words may not be sufficiently polite at times, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m still making mistakes, but I took quite a few orders, and served plenty more people than before. I also learned (not really an appropriate word, but it&rsquo;ll have to do) how to change the grille on the brazier used to cook the meat, and how to clean up tables after customers have left. I got asked a few questions by some salarymen, and ended up talking to two guys for 5 minutes or so after I&rsquo;d delivered them their tea. If things keep going this way, I might actually have a chance to use more Japanese than I thought I would, but the scope of conversation is rather limited. Nonetheless, I was pleased that someone went out of their way to talk to me. I also learned that I can&rsquo;t guess people&rsquo;s age, unless it&rsquo;s really obvious. I thought my 17 year old co-worker was a university student, which she seemed pleased about. Thinking about it now, aren&rsquo;t people of the female persuasion supposed to be annoyed when you guess their age above what it actually is? Perhaps it&rsquo;s different for high school students.</p>

<p>My shift finished, and I was rather tired after standing for 4 hours straight. Given my usual sedentary lifestyle sitting in front of a computer screen in a not-particularly-comfortable chair for 12+ hours a day, this is not really surprising. I got home, and decided to check my emails, and there was one from Keio. For a moment I disregarded it as some more information about something I wasn&rsquo;t particularly interested in, but I read it anyway. I was rather surprised to find that I had been selected as a recipient of the additional allocation JASSO scholarship, whatever that may mean. Whatever it means, the key point is that I have been allocated this scholarship for three months. The JASSO scholarship was something that we could apply for during the application period for the study abroad year, and of course I went for it, because why the hell not. It&rsquo;s a scholarship from the Japanese government (who seem to really like handing out money to foreign people, even though they seem to dislike them rather a lot [see: JET]), which gives a monthly stipend of ￥80,000. Some students get this for the whole study abroad period, but I don&rsquo;t think that anyone from Birmingham has received it. I&rsquo;m rather pleased to get this, since the current state of the pound/yen is massively in the favour of the yen at the moment (i.e. the pound is terrible), and it will mean that at least I can feel a little bit more free about spending some money. Also, a scholarship is a nice thing to put on my CV, even though I can&rsquo;t even remember why it&rsquo;s awarded (I seem to remember it being randomly chosen, but that is surely incorrect).</p>

<p>Maybe today wasn&rsquo;t a good day after all. I&rsquo;m inexperienced in experiencing good days, so I can&rsquo;t tell.</p>

<p>Oh well.</p>

    <h2><a href="/2011/12/some-imaginative-title.html">Some imaginative title</a></h2>
    Dec 11, 2011

    <section class="postcontent">
    <p>Even though it hasn&rsquo;t been so long since I last wrote something, I thought I might as well - in part due to not really feeling like doing any work.</p>

<p>I had my first proper shift at my part time job on Friday, which was interesting, for lack of a better word. Most food establishments here use handheld devices to take orders from customers, so I was tested a little on my ability to use that. Given that I&rsquo;m used to using user interfaces which aren&rsquo;t particularly fantastic, that side of things isn&rsquo;t much of a problem. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple touch screen interface which is divided into various sections for alcoholic drinks, non-alcoholic drinks, Japanese meat, pork, so on and so forth. The main problem with it is that you have to be able to use it fast, and since I&rsquo;ve had no practice at all, it often takes me quite a while to find what&rsquo;s been ordered. Not being able to read Japanese quickly also factors into this.</p>

<p>As you may know, Japanese service etiquette is very polite. While this may be nice from the customer&rsquo;s point of view, from the employee&rsquo;s perspective, this is quite a significant problem, in particular in my case. An often used phrase to describe this is &ldquo;マヌアル通り&rdquo;, which can be roughly translated as &ldquo;by the book&rdquo;. Companies often have manuals which employees are often required to follow when speaking to customers. Of course, how strongly enforced this policy is depends on the establishment. If you&rsquo;re at an upper class restaurant, then the likelihood is that things will be repeated word for word for maximum politeness and minimum possibility of offending the customer. Where I&rsquo;m working, we&rsquo;re able to change stuff around, as long as the general feeling (and of course the meaning) of what is written comes across. I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time outside of work hours memorising parts of this manual, because that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re expected to do. One would think that once you leave work, it isn&rsquo;t a problem to forget about it until your next shift. However, in Japan, that&rsquo;s not the case. The example I&rsquo;ve described above is not by any means the only example. Although it&rsquo;s not really on the same level, salarymen are often required to go drinking after work, for some sort of team bonding - this often means that your general work day ends up being from 7 (so you can get on the train to get to work on time) to 10 or later. Sounds like fun.</p>

<p>At any rate, my shift started with me attempting to familiarise myself with the usage of the so-called &ldquo;handy&rdquo; by looking through the various menus and trying to find stuff as quickly as possible. After some time doing that, I was tested on my ability to repeat the words in the manual in the correct order, which wasn&rsquo;t bad, but &ldquo;needs more practice&rdquo;. Gradually, the shop started to fill up, so I was tasked with delivering stuff to tables. Luckily, there&rsquo;s no need to remember the names of the dishes - when an order is done, it&rsquo;s placed on a counter with a little card saying what it is, and which table it needs to go to. Unfortunately, some of the dishes are to be eaten in a specific way, so sometimes it&rsquo;s necessary to explain that, rather than just saying what it is and excusing yourself. After doing that for a while, I was introduced to the method of taking breaks. First you have to check out on your time card (no getting paid while on break), and then you can grab some food. Was pretty tasty. One of the chefs had prepared some beef stir fry type thing, and I had rice with kimchi on it, on top of that. Spent half an hour talking to one of the guys who has been working there for a while about various things. Back on the shift, I carried on serving for a little bit. By this time, the place was completely full, so everyone was pretty busy. Dirty dishes were stacking up, so I was shown how to work the dishwasher. Now, having been in charge of emptying the dishwasher at home for many years, I&rsquo;m pretty confident in my abilities in this area. However, I was rather taken aback by the speed at which the restaurant manager loaded and unloaded the trays used for putting dishes on. It seems obvious now that the restaurant would have an industrial-type dishwasher, but I was sort of expecting stuff to be done manually. Once a tray is loaded, you shove it into the dishwasher and close the lid, as it were. It looks like a sort of press, but details are unimportant. Once the lid is down, you have 90 seconds in which to unload the washed dishes and load up the tray with dirty stuff. After about an hour and a half, I had things going pretty well. I was kind of expecting to be bored of doing essentially the same thing over and over, but actually it wasn&rsquo;t too bad. Compared to one of my previous jobs where I often had nothing to do for a few hours a day, actually having something to do is a blessing. At least I can challenge myself to see how fast I can get things done, and work out the most efficient methods of loading and unloading in order to save time. It&rsquo;s pretty difficult to challenge oneself when there&rsquo;s nothing to do.</p>

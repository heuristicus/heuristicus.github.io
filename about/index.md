My name is Michal Staniaszek. I'm a student of Robotics and Artificial
Intelligence currently based in Birmingham, UK. I studied Computer Science at
the University of Birmingham where I co-founded the
[Birmingham Autonomous Robotics Club](http://barcuk.github.io/index.html). I
spent my third year in Tokyo, Japan, at Keio university where I studied Japanese
language. I currently speak English, Polish and Japanese fluently, and have
basic knowledge of French, German and Swedish. I learn languages for fun. I'm
also fluent in C/C++ and Java. When I have time, I
take photographs of things that catch my eye---patterns and contrast in
particular.
		
## Where am I?
You can find me at various places on the internet, including:

- [Github](https://github.com/heuristicus) --- Almost all the code I've ever
  written.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MStaniaszek) --- Maybe one day...
- [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=236650527) --- Things I've done.
- [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/) --- Some of my more
  presentable photography.

## Contact
The best way to contact me is by email. If you're not a robot, then you
should be able to remove the five uppercase letters in front of the address that
follows.

ROBOTm.staniaszek@gmail.com

If you can do that and you _are_ a robot, then let me know.

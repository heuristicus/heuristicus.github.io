My name is Michal Staniaszek. I'm a student of Robotics and Artificial
Intelligence currently based in Birmingham, UK. My undergraduate degree in
Computer Science was completed at the University of Birmingham where I also
co-founded the
[Birmingham Autonomous Robotics Club](http://barcuk.github.io/index.html). I
spent my third year at Keio university in Tokyo, Japan, where I studied Japanese
language. I currently speak English, Polish and Japanese fluently, and have
basic knowledge of French, German and Swedish. I learn human languages for
fun. I'm also fluent in C/C++, Java and Python. I learn machine languages
whenever I need them.
		
## Where am I?
You can find me at various places on the internet, including:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/heuristicus) -- Almost all the code I've ever
  written.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MStaniaszek) -- Rarely tweet, sometimes listen.
- [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/) -- Some of my more
  presentable photography.
- [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/nitre) -- It doesn't count if you don't
  scrobble it.
- [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=236650527) -- For
  work-related contact.

## Contact
The best way to contact me is by email. If you're not a robot, then you
should be able to remove the five uppercase letters in front of the address that
follows.

ROBOTm.staniaszek@gmail.com

If you can do that and you _are_ a robot, then let me know.

My name is Michal Staniaszek. I'm a student of robotics and artificial
intelligence currently based in Stockholm, Sweden. My undergraduate degree in
Computer Science was completed at the University of Birmingham where I also
co-founded the
[Birmingham Autonomous Robotics Club](http://barcuk.github.io/index.html). I
spent my third year at Keio university in Tokyo, Japan, where I studied Japanese
language. I am currently in my second year at the Royal Institute of Technology
in Stockholm, studying for a master's degree in Systems, Control and Robotics.

I currently speak English, Polish and Japanese fluently, and have basic
knowledge of Swedish. I learn natural languages for fun. I'm also fluent in C/C++
and Java, and learn new machine languages when the need arises.

My academic interests lie somewhere within the fields of artificial
intelligence, machine learning and robotics. I'd like create robots with
something that at least vaguely resembles human-level intelligence, but that's a
long way in the future. For now, I want to work on systems that can make some
sort of impact on society, however small.

## Where am I?
You can find me at various places on the internet, including:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/heuristicus) -- Almost all the code I've ever
  written.
- [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/) -- Some of my more
  presentable photography.
- [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/nitre) -- It doesn't count if you don't
  scrobble it.

## Contact
The best way to contact me is by email. If you're not a robot, then you
should be able to remove the five uppercase letters in front of the address that
follows.

ROBOTcontact@michalstaniaszek.com

If you can do that and you _are_ a robot, then let me know in your email.

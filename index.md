My name is Michal Staniaszek. I'm a student of robotics and artificial
intelligence currently based in Stockholm, Sweden. My undergraduate degree in
Computer Science was completed at the University of Birmingham where I also
co-founded the
[Birmingham Autonomous Robotics Club](http://barcuk.github.io/index.html). I
spent my third year at Keio university in Tokyo, Japan, where I studied Japanese
language. I am currently in my second year at the Royal Institute of Technology
in Stockholm, studying for a master's degree in Systems, Control and Robotics.

I currently speak English, Polish and Japanese fluently, and have basic
knowledge of Swedish. I learn natural languages for fun. I'm also fluent in C/C++
and Java, and learn new machine languages when the need arises.

My academic interests lie somewhere within the fields of artificial
intelligence, machine learning and robotics. I'd like create robots with
something that at least vaguely resembles human-level intelligence.

profile](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=236650527).

I spend most of my free time reading about things that I feel I don't know much
about. I enjoy reading science fiction for its exploration of the effects of
technological advancement on human society. I also spend a lot of time reading
Japanese novels and popular science books, both to maintain my language skills
and to see things from a different cultural perspective. One of my favourite
websites is YouTube, where I find a lot of interesting stuff, but my staples are
the [Vlogbrothers](http://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers) and their side
projects [SciShow](http://www.youtube.com/user/scishow),
[Crash Course](http://www.youtube.com/user/crashcourse) and
[The Brain Scoop](http://www.youtube.com/user/thebrainscoop).
[Smarter Every Day](http://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2),
[CGPGrey](http://www.youtube.com/user/CGPGrey),
[Veritasium](http://www.youtube.com/user/1veritasium),
[Numberphile](http://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile),
[Sixty Symbols](http://www.youtube.com/user/sixtysymbols),
[Periodic Videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/periodicvideos) and
[Vsauce](http://www.youtube.com/user/vsauce) also provide me with much
entertainment, insight and food for thought.

If I don't have my head in a book, or my eyes on YouTube, I'm usually riding my
bicycle. It's almost got to the point where I don't like walking because it's
just too slow. I sometimes take breaks by going somewhere I haven't been before
and walking around aimlessly with my camera. You can find some examples of the
sort of photographs I take at the [photo](/photo) pages.

## Where am I?
You can find me at various places on the internet, including:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/heuristicus) -- Almost all the code I've ever
  written.
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MStaniaszek) -- Rarely tweet, sometimes listen.
- [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/) -- Some of my more
  presentable photography.
- [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/nitre) -- It doesn't count if you don't
  scrobble it.

## Contact
The best way to contact me is by email. If you're not a robot, then you
should be able to remove the five uppercase letters in front of the address that
follows.

ROBOTcontact@michalstaniaszek.com

If you can do that and you _are_ a robot, then let me know.

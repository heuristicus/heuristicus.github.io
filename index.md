My name is Michal Staniaszek. My academic interests lie somewhere within the
intersection of artificial intelligence, computer vision and robotics. I'd like
create robots with something that at least vaguely resembles human-level
intelligence, but that's a long way in the future. For now, I want to work on
autonomous systems that can make some sort of impact on society, however small.

My undergraduate degree in Computer Science was completed at the University of
Birmingham in the UK. I spent my third year at Keio university in Tokyo, Japan,
where I studied Japanese. I completed my master's degree in Systems, Control and
Robotics at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. Since then,
I interned for 6 months at Yujin Robot in South Korea, and was briefly a PhD
candidate at Fraunhofer IPA.

My main language is English, but I also speak Polish and Japanese well, and have
some basic knowledge of German, Swedish and Korean. I learn natural languages
for fun. I'm fluent in C++ and Python, and learn new machine languages when the
need arises.

## Where am I?
You can find me at various places on the internet, including:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/heuristicus) -- Almost all the code I've ever
  written.
- [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mstaniaszek/) -- Some of my more
  presentable photography.
- [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/nitre) -- It doesn't count if you don't
  scrobble it.

## Contact
The best way to contact me is by email. If you're not a robot, then you
should be able to remove the five uppercase letters in front of the address that
follows.

ROBOTcontact@michalstaniaszek.com

If you can do that and you _are_ a robot, then let me know in your email.
